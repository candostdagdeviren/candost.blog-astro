Wisdom is the moral quality of knowing what you don’t know; it’s learning and handling your ignorance and limitations. You can [learn someone else’s knowledge](/notes/69/), but it will be mere information for you. Turning that information into knowledge and then later wisdom, you must understand how much you don’t know.
