Exponential increases in scope create only linear understanding in humans. When planning an event, a year ahead may seem far off. However, planning an event 5 years or 10 years ahead doesn’t feel 5x or 10x one year from now. We can’t comprehend the scope. Between 5 years and 10 years, there are five more years. However, both 5 years and 10 years seem very close to the human brain. We can neither visualize nor feel the real difference. This is called [Scope Insensitivity](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy).
