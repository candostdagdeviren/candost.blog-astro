When you’re hosting a workshop to resolve collaboration problems between teams, project kick off, or something similar that require teams (or even people) to collaborate, you can use “What I Need From You Matrix.”

| What I need from you | Team A         | Team B         | Team C         |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Team A               | x              | A needs from B | A needs from C |
| Team B               | B needs from A | x              | B needs from C |
| Team C               | C needs from A | C needs from B | x              |

The matrix allow each team (or person) to voice their needs from others. The goal is bringing clarity to expectations and aligning everyone.
