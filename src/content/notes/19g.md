We need to separate two things to make better decisions: the person who offers us something and the offer itself. Before agreeing with the person (be it a sales manager, [leader](/notes/20f/) or friend), we can ask ourselves, “Do I like this person [more than](/notes/20h/) I expected?” If yes, we can separate the offer and the person. This separation in mind [helps uncover the impact](/notes/20d/) of the likeliness of the person on our decisions. This way, we [protect ourselves from people’s influence](/notes/80/) on us.

- **Related Note(s):**
  - When [leaders communicate decisions with you](/notes/32/), think about [how much you like](/notes/87/) them to evaluate their decisions fairly.
  - [The feedback you receive is about you and the other person](/notes/40/). That means how much you like each other (or you like the other person) will weigh the acceptance rate of the received feedback.
