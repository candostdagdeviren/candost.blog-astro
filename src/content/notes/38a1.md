We are consistent with how we define ourselves. We [stick](/notes/25a/) to our commitments toward others (not really for ourselves). In other people’s eyes, we do whatever it takes to live up to our words. It sometimes causes us trouble (like people in the street asking for a donation signature and then using it to scam), and sometimes it works like magic (like when we publicly commit to our goals). We [work hard](/notes/25/) to [live up to our commitments](/notes/52c/) and ensure we’re perceived as consistent.
