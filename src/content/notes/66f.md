If everything is urgent, nothing is urgent. I see people share an RFC to collect feedback and tell the audience that they will close the RFC for comments in two days. If everything is urgent, how can people read an RFC while other urgent tasks are waiting for them?

Of course, it depends on the RFC. If an RFC is circulating in one team, it's okay to have two days because there are only a handful of people who need to review it. The problem occurs when an RFC impacts more than one team. As every team's priorities are different, people cannot jump into reviewing an RFC when it's shared. Authors have to give enough time for others to review. How much is enough will always depend on the topic and the RFC's impact.
