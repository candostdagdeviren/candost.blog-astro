Great engineering managers have strong debugging skills and know how to apply them to non-technical problems. They pursue 'the why' of the problem before jumping to conclusions. They seek the underlying issue and don't stop at half-baked ideas.

When managers skip this debugging mindset and jump to conclusions, they solve the wrong problem—one nobody cares about. This not only undermines their abilities within the team but also creates additional problems.
