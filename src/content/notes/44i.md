The fish is never aware of its surroundings. Everywhere is water for it; thus, it will never learn from its environment. Humans form stereotypical thoughts according to the environment they are in. Due to the biological nature of stereotypical beliefs, breaking them requires going out of the route and getting into someone else's shoes. Like [asking questions to convince people](/notes/44h/), we have to ask questions that can challenge these stereotypical thoughts. If we want people to reconsider their stance on specific arguments, we need to ask questions that nudge them to explore the origins of their ideas and beliefs. Once they start exploring how they formed these stereotypes, they realize how easy it was to build them.
