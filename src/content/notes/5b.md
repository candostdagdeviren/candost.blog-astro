When we look at high performers in our teams, there are usually two types of people: superstars and rock stars. Superstars seek steep growth and look for changes constantly. They are ambitious at work, and if we don't challenge them with growth opportunities, they will leave because of boredom.

On the other hand, there are rock stars. Rock as a stone, not music. These people perform in the position they are in, and they are happy there. If we force them to promotion, they will run away. If we push them further because they have great potential, we make a mistake.

Identifying each person and understanding their desire is vital. That's why instead of focusing on the potential of the people, we should focus on growth.
