> “Tears fall for a reason, and they are your strength, not weakness.” — The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse

[Make your weakness your strength](/notes/7a/). If you cry, that doesn’t show that you’re weak. It shows that you deeply care about something. When you cry, [look for](/notes/3b6a/) what exactly you are crying for. Once you find it, that’s your strength. [Embrace it](/notes/46h/) and turn it into a superpower for the rest of your life.
