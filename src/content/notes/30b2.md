When we experience a negative emotion, it is a way for our body to nudge us to change our conditions; it is a call to action. Our body tells us to avoid all triggers that cause the negative experience. Our hormones have evolved to tell us that unpleasant experiences shouldn't be repeated.

On the other hand, the same is true for positive experiences. When we're happy or satisfied, our hormones are arranged in a way that tells us to keep the experience and not seek change.

It's only logical that our hormones decide what we're annoyed by and what we enjoy.
