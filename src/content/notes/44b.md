Our perception differs from others about situations, ourselves, and our behaviors. For example, when someone fails, we think that they are not capable of the job or don't have what it takes. But when we fail, we say and believe that the situation was not great and that other problems caused the failure. We don't say that we're not capable.
The difference in perspectives is the point that requires more empathy. While preparing or receiving feedback, we need to think from both perspectives and correctly analyze the root cause to act accurately.
