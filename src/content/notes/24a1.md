One of the main reasons for the importance of teams in organizations is the sense of unity behind a common goal. When the goal (or other reasons for uniting people) are not apparent, [people start](/notes/44f/) going [after one another](/notes/40b/). However, once they [merge](/notes/34/) behind a common goal and feel “the whole team is one of them,” they do and achieve remarkable things. Moreover, people feel united and do more for the group. They go the extra mile and go out of their way to help others in the team.

- **Related Note(s):**
  - If you [join a new team](/notes/3b/), [audit in three pillars](/notes/3b7/) to understand how they formed unity by doing things together. Find what keeps them together.
  - When [structuring teams in an organization](/notes/56/), try to find common elements between team members before putting them on the same team.
