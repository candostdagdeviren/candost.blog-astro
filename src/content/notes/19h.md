We need to separate expertise and authority to defend against the influence of authority. Simply asking ourselves, “Is this authority an expert on the topic?” and “How truthful can we expect this expert to be?” will help with the separation. Once the authority's influence is [separated](/notes/9/), it’s easy to destroy its influence and [make a better judgment and decision](/notes/80/). This method will help with purchasing products (as many products use well-known people to establish authority wrongly) and with following leaders at work (not [every comment of a leader](/notes/19e/) signals their expertise; sometimes, people have an opinion without knowledge).
