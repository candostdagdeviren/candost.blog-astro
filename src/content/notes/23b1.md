Obnoxious Aggression occurs when you give feedback without personally caring about the person. Feedback goes out as pure, non-constructive criticism. It becomes a slap in the face, and you become an asshole boss who stabs people while looking in the eye.

Obnoxious Aggression also occurs in praise. If you give praise without personally caring about the other side, the praise becomes empty and even detrimental. It begins to be seen as insincere and disgusts people.
