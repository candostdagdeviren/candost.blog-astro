As an engineering director (or manager of managers at any level), you need to [compartmentalize your teams](/notes/56j/) around visions. [Ask yourself what your vision for the group is.](/notes/34/) As a director, [you don’t have full context](/notes/61/) on anything, so [don’t try to gain too deep context](/notes/9/).
