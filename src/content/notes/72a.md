When we commit to something small and that tiny thing gets bigger, we need to stop and analyze what’s going on and whether we need to keep the same direction. Strong consistency drivers push us to follow the same promises and thoughts more and eventually be the victims of the sunk cost fallacy. This, in combination with consistent identity drivers, can put us into situations we don’t want or expect to happen. Getting out of this situation requires us to listen to our gut and ask ourselves, “Knowing what I know now, would I make the same decision again?” If not, then get out.
