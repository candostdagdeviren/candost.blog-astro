The meetings are where the actual work happens. Don’t think you don’t have time to complete the work. In the meetings, thoughts are discussed, ideas are reviewed, and decisions are made.

There is no escape from the meetings in management. Even if the team is remote, you’ll have 1:1s, planning meetings, etc. It’s not avoidable.
