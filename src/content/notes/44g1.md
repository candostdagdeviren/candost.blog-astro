Peer-suasion is [a strong behavior](/notes/20d/). We follow others who are like us. The similarity bonds even further, and people do even more similar things. This is also visible in teenagers; they rebel against their parents but strongly follow the rules in teenage groups. I also observe this as a manager and in my daily life. [When I mention something I’m doing to my direct reports at work](/notes/53/), they are less likely to replicate. However, if [I praise their peers](/notes/23/), they replicate the praised behavior more. I also do the same with my friends. I observe that we [start using similar phrases or doing similar behaviors](/notes/20h/) when we’re in the group and bond more if we share the same language. However, knowing the peer-suasion influence, I sometimes deflect using the exact phrases.
