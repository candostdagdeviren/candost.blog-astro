When you sell a technical initiative as a business case successfully, you can use that initiative as an umbrella for others. If other initiatives will contribute to the business case you sold (it doesn’t have to be a strong contributor), you can include them as well after you sell it. This looks sneaky at first, but it’s actually your job to make things happen on the engineering side. If you are able to explain how the things you include are related to the case you sold, it’s fine. The stage test is a good model for thinking: if you can answer the question in front of the whole company in public, then it’s alright. For example, if you sold Continuous Delivery as a business need, you can include some migration efforts and focus on tech debt in it.
