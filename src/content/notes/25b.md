When we fail to form a new habit or get rid of a bad one, we focus on having motivation. But, what we need is clarity on the time and location of the habit. When we have vague dreams, it is easy to rationalize small excuses not to follow the change. Making the actions more obvious helps to take conscious actions in a certain way, even without motivation. The Atomic Habits book suggests using the formula "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
