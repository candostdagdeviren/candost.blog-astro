Conflicts are healthy in relationships. Always agreeing with each other will demand sacrifice from one side. One side hides their true thoughts or accumulates resentment that bursts out after a while. The relationship feels fake, not natural.

Society forces us to be the same, although individuals differ. Always confirming with each other and avoiding conflicts prevent us from finding the truth. When there is no truth in the relationship, we cannot be honest and, therefore, cannot form trust.
