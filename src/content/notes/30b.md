Suffering and pain are born from a biological need during evolution. Humans seek to suffer all the time. That's why, regardless of richness, poverty, aloneness, being entirely social, hungriness, and fullness, everyone suffers from different things. Because evolution is based on small changes and adaption to the environment. When humans (or all creatures) suffer, they seek to change. If we don't suffer and be happy all the time, we wouldn't be looking for any single change. "Only mildly dissatisfied and painful creatures can put the work to innovate and survive." If there is no dissatisfaction, we never move a finger to change anything. Because we're happy with the current situation, we're driven by our biological needs.
