Whatever we talk about, whatever we preach comes from doubt. We never try to convince others about [things that will indeed happen](/notes/29a/). It’s the things that we have doubts about. We don’t admit that we have doubts when we follow a strong idea almost blindly. We are sure inside ourselves but simultaneously full of doubts. We choose to believe in it. And we follow that doubt till the end.

When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it’s always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.” from “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values” by Robert M.
