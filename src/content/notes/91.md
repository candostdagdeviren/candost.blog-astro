Online social networks have passed their promise of creating a social network. It feeds the desire for attention in a competitive market. We seek the likes of people we didn’t know existed. This hyper-competitive side of social networking technology takes our time immensely in return for, simply put, nothing. The currency of likes is not worth a dime.
