> You’re the torch as a coach that’s been used by a person in a cave. You’re not taking the journey by yourself; you’re there to light up the way for the other person.

Coaching is not about giving advice directly. It’s about [taking the person through a journey](/notes/3/) and [showing them the way](/notes/6/). You’re not there to teach them a topic. You’re there to notice what the person does, [ask questions](/notes/68/), and [give them a space](/notes/33a/) to figure things out on their own.
