How we handle something to which we lose access or have limited access changes everything. Our perspective can increase our arousal or call it enough that we [don’t seek it](/notes/30d/) anymore. Separating the value from our desire for it gives us a much-needed perspective.

- **Related Note(s):**
  - When [communicating decisions that remove access to something](/notes/32/), explain the value of losing that access and the rationale behind the decision.
  - [Retrospective thinking makes the lessons apparent](/notes/68/) when we can’t separate the desire from the value.
  - [While purchasing/selling something](/notes/80/), be aware of the scarcity driver.
