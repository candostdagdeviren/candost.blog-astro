Regardless of its form, belonging to a place unites people, similar to belonging to a family. Not only kinship, but also people who look alike actually like each other more. Also, when people come from similar places or families, they like each other more. Commonalities increase belonging. This closeness in proximity peaks when we invite people to our homes. As homes are the most intimate places, people visiting homes as guests are liked more, and they feel they belong to a closer group after being invited, the family. When we want to increase unity or likeness, we can gradually invite people and involve them in dinner preparations. Acting like they are part of the family allows us to create stronger bonds, improving the relationship overall.
