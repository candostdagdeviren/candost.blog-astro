As an engineering director (or executive), [compartmentalize your teams around visions](/notes/24a1/). What’s [your vision for the group](/notes/34/)? You’ll not have full context on anything about these teams. Don’t try gaining too deep context unless it’s absolutely needed. Once the teams are built around a vision, [the group can create context and use it to achieve their mission](/notes/20m/).
