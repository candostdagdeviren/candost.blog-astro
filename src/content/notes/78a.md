Track capacity allocation in retrospective rather than for future. This way you know what the team spent time on the last month(s). Categorize the work in three categories: tech debt, product improvements, and new features. Once you accumulate some data around how much time the team(s) spend on each category, you can bring clarity to the business around what the team is dealing with and the data can help you identify problematic areas where engineers spent a lot of time on tech debt.
