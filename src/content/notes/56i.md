The most difficult part of facilitating interaction mode is to create an [enabling team that consists of experts](/notes/56d2/). Because experts rarely want to work as an enabler. However, I think staff engineers are the perfect solution for being in the enabling team. I actually think that they are a one-person enabling team. Some of them still build software but especially [solver and architect archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes) are kind of in an enabling mode.
