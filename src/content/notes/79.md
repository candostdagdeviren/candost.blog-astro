In all engineering problems like tech debt, focus on business case first. Telling executives (like CEO) or product management that tech debt has to be worked on will not work. You have to understand the business first and then find the impact of tech debt to the business. If people are complaining that the team speed is slow, find out why. Is it because of the tech debt or because of the lacking capabilities around continuous delivery. Once you found it, explain the problem’s impact to the business with clear impact evaluation and how you’ll make it better and how people will track that it gets better. Don’t start from the tech debt and explaining that you need time; it won’t work.
