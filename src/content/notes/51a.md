- _Dirty writes:_ It happens when a transaction overwrites the value that is written by another transaction that hasn't been committed yet.
- _Dirty reads:_ A transaction reads a value from a write transaction that is not committed yet.
- _Fuzzy Read:_ It happens when a transaction sees two different results when reading a value twice. When the difference is caused by committing another transaction, the value comes from pre-commit and after-commit.
- _Phantom Read:_ It happens when a transaction reads a set of objects whiles another transaction changes some of the data; thus, it affects the result of the read.
