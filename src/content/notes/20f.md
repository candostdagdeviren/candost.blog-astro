While working as a leader, you have better chances to get compliance when people genuinely like you. Work toward offering your team and stakeholders fair judgment and being liked. Your stakeholders will especially try to go the extra mile to help you if they like you. Establishing this likeness early on will help you influence their decisions. I used to see this as bad politics in organizations; however, itâ€™s human instinct. You need to learn how to play this diplomacy. You need to convert your target audience to supporters of your approach and ideas. For that, you start with creating a profile of being liked.
The same is true of your team as a leader. The more liked you are, the more they will go the extra mile to comply with your direction.
