The most convincing code review happens in four steps. First, make it obvious: explain in a very detailed form. Don't just say, please change X to Y. Explain the why so the change should be very obvious. Second, make it attractive: explain the benefits of the change. Make the change request very attractive that they want to do it. Third, make it easy. Don't request a full rewrite. Your changes shouldn't create hesitancy or devastation, on the other side. Last, make it satisfying. They should "get" a reward after that. You can praise their effort, or do other things to make the code review satisfying. These cannot be done all at the same time. These are in an endless loop and in order. Once there is satisfaction, it should feed into the loop again.
