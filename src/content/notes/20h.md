Similarities create comfort; we like people who are similar to us. When someone we admire and consider, as they know everything, says, “I don’t know,” it creates a familiarity, showing that they are like us; they don’t know.

Creating familiarity and similarity brings people closer to you. Regardless of where and how you use this, you can turn this into an advantage. For example, when you present a topic in public, you can interact with someone known to the audience to increase their attentiveness.
