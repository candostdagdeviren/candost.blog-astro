Similarities create comfort; we like people similar to us. When someone we admire and consider them as they know everything says, “I don’t know” it creates a familiarity showing that they are like us, they don’t know.

Creating the familiarity and similarity brings people closer to you. Independent of where and how you use it, you can turn this into advantage. For example, when you’re presenting a topic in public, you can add your interaction with someone known to the audience so you increase the attentiveness of audience.
