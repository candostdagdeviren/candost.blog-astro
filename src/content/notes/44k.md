Polarization is one of the biggest problems in the information age. Creating echo chambers is easy. When we face charged conversations or opposing perspectives, we often discard them and stay in our comfort zone. One of the fundamental reasons for polarization is discussing the why.

When we find common ground and realize that we can actually focus on the *how* part of the problem, we expose ourselves to different perspectives—we overcome binary bias. Coming to this position is not easy. When we face unknowns and uncertainties, we raise our defensive walls.

To unstuck ourselves from binary bias, we must be exposed to different perspectives and become more doubtful.
