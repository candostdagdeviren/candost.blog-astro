Action → Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Inspiration → Motivation → Action ...

The "Do something principle" and [Bias for Action](/bias-towards-action/) have different perspectives on motivation and inspiration. If you wait for motivation to arrive or look for inspiration, then you most probably won't find it. Even when you do, you probably won't take any action about it. You will procrastinate if you approach in this way.

If you take action and do something before waiting for anything (no inspiration, no motivation), the rest will follow. This is a painful process, and to be able to proceed further, accept this pain, and do something, it doesn't matter what. You will see the results. For example, if you want to write, don't wait for inspiration. Just start putting word after another. The inspiration will find you.
