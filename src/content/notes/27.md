Don't act, do it. When you are doing something, don't act like you are doing it. If your procrastination comes from being in motion (preparing or acting like you are doing), you need to change something. Instead of simply satisfying yourself and feeling better from vaguely doing something, focus on what you do and try to produce results often.
