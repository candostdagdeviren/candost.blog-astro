In layered architectures, we can set up isolation between layers. It means the changes in one layer won't impact or affect any other layers, providing the contracts between layers remain unchanged. This isolation helps the software architect replace any layer with comfort when necessary. For example, a presentation layer developed with Angular can be replaced with React easily without having any impact on the layers below.

Wrappers partially do this job but on the lower levels. Isolating a presentation layer enables us to even use very different languages and frameworks. We should be able to replace Angular with Spring MVC, for example.
