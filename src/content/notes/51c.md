In a [strong consistency model](/notes/51b/), the read operations have the extra time cost of the leader asking all followers to decide if it's still a leader. We can solve this by allowing followers to read the data as well. However, their data might not be up-to-date. Since the leader sends/ensures that followers receive data sequentially, it cannot guarantee real-time data. But the order will be the same. This situation differs from the strong consistency.

Also, with this approach, we pin a client to a follower.
