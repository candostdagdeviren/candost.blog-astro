When making investment decision, try to understand why. Do you like someone working there? Do you like the leadership or the culture of the company? Maybe someone famous you like recommended the business? Do you know someone working there? If your friend is working there, you have a higher chance to like a business. If your friend invested in a business, you are more likely to invest as well. Itâ€™s okay to invest in a company you like, you only need to know so you can make a better call.
