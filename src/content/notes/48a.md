The systems that can tolerate the faults are called fault-tolerant or resilient. Fully reliable systems are like a dream we can never reach. There will always be a possibility of failure. An earthquake can happen, and the earth might explode. So, full reliability is not possible and not feasible. Therefore, our goal is to have resilient systems, not fully reliable systems.
