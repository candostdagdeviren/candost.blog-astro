People model you as a leader. How you do anything is how you do everything.
People observe you and [look up to you all the time](/notes/9d/). How you [behave in a meeting](/notes/77/), how you approach a problem, and how you resolve an issue will be [reflected in people](/notes/54/). Even when you want the least, like when you take a wrong action, it can change how people evaluate you in a way that reversing it will take years. Act thoughtfully, don’t [impulse react](/notes/20d/) and approach every single moment mindfully.
