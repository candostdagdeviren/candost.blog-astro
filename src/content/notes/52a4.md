Building character is defending against the [short-term wins](/notes/27d/) of [your ego and pride](/notes/30b3/).  Only self-discipline and quieting ourselves, investing in long-term wins, can show the way to enlightenment, a fulfilled life that is driven by purpose. If we become slaves of lust, fear, and vanity, we distance ourselves from courage, [honesty](/notes/3b3/), and [humility](/notes/44h/). Self-discipline is what anchors us to stick with a permanent and important thing in the long term, rather than collecting the short-term benefits that have detrimental results over time.
