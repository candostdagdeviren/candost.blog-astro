Take the first step to share feedback. [The rule of reciprocation](/notes/30d1/) can play a big role when you want to get feedback, too. Especially for the positive feedback, take the extra time to provide it in the most visible way. This favor will get its return when you need feedback, too. While the other person thanks for the feedback, don’t just discard it by saying, “You’re welcome” or “No problem at all,” use the opportunity to enforce the rule of reciprocation by saying, “If our positions are reversed, I’m sure you’d do the same.”
