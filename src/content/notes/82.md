As an engineering leader, your job is to convince the business to invest in increasing developer productivity. This investment often needs time to bring returns, and you have to make it clear to the business. Start by aligning the business before talking about productivity. Bring problems to business according to business plans. Find out what’s essential for you and what your expectations are from metrics (e.g., DORA). Having productivity metrics doesn’t work on their own. You have to set expectations with the teams right and align with the business on these expectations, too. In the end, engineering leadership is not about shipping code; it’s helping the company win by shipping code. Focus on how you can help the company win.
