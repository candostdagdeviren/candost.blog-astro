- Put a step-by-step plan, start small, and try to deliver value quickly.
- Have your budget in the strategy.
- Consider sickness & vacation in your plans.
- Consider the [impact of side work](/notes/37a/) on your plans.
- PoC and step-by-step guides are good.
- Know your audience.
- When you go to a board meeting, go with multiple options (and with your recommendation).
- Don’t put a wall of text in the presentation.
- Say [**three things**](/notes/17f/) to leave on people’s minds and tie all of the rest to those three points, and address them.
- Don’t just mention risks, but also show your plans for addressing them. (e.g., [tech debt](/notes/79/))
