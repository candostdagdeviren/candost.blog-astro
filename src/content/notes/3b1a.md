A manager may micromanage a subordinate because they most probably don’t trust the person or they have [control](/notes/4/) issues (which also relate to trust).

The manager doesn’t believe that the task will be done right or in the way that they would do it to high standards. Many managers feel that they are responsible for the work their subordinates do; they often confuse responsibility and accountability. They are accountable for the job. However, they are not responsible. With high trust, the manager can leave the job to the subordinate without micromanaging them.
