In large batch-size deployments, people become disconnected from the changes they made. Because there is a time gap between changes and deployments, they forget what they have fixed. And this might create new problems because if something goes wrong, they will not be able to fix that.

Psychological safety gets lower. Since the changes are significant and the risk of failure is high, people canâ€™t have a safety net anymore. The no-returning back (or problematic returning back) hurts psychology.
