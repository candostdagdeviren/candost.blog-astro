## Rewrite to learn what you didn't write

When we rewrite the text we have written, we learn about the parts we didn't know before. The first writing puts the raw idea out. Editing and rewriting shape the idea and perfect it. Putting the raw idea on paper is a sculptor's drawing on the paper; rewriting it is making the sculpture. We see the small details and nuances when we start rewriting. We connect dots that we missed at first. We learn what we haven't thought about yet.
