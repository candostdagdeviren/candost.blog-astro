TV changed the world in a way we can’t imagine. In the long term, we can see how much people trust what they see on TV. It became a single source of information for many as it changed [people's habits](/notes/27/). The Internet did the same. It took decades, but it steadily got its place to provide information. LLM is the next but the most problematic one. With each invention, people lost intellectuality. They trust whatever they see. The difference between LLM and the other two is that LLM is not able [to know the source of truth](/notes/30/). There is no way to validate the truth of output. That’s why it can’t be used in [learning](/notes/65/). You have to [stay skeptical and research to validate](/notes/69/).
