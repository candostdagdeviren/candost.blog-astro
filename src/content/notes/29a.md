> "Bet on things that won't change rather than predicting how things will change." — Jason Cohen

Many experts fail to predict the future because many things change constantly. However, there are a few things that never change, and we know that they will always be there. For example, customers will always want low prices and high-quality customer service (that's what Amazon bets on). Find what doesn't change on your product, domain, or even life, and bet on them. Be strong on that front and follow what life brings you, and adapt to changes.
