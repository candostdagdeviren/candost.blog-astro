It's a psychological phenomenon that indicates humans change their behaviors if they know they are being observed.

At the Western Electric plant, a study was conducted in the 1920s to explore methods of enhancing workers' productivity. The experiment involved manipulating the lighting conditions in the factory. Workers were divided into two groups, one working under varying light levels and the other under normal light.
