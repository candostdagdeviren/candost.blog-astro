## Going backwards in discrimination

Discrimination is hidden in seemingly small, invisible daily interactions. A short police control in an international airport, a small chat in a government office, a short look of a local in the public transport. I know that it’s natural to have these uncontrolled moments. We’re tend to identify the foreigner or outsider. This mechanism is built over thousands of years; it helped human race to survive. And the modern world is going against all our habitual patterns and tells us not do identify others as foreigners. That’s the root of our struggles as a community and species. We have to change, much quicker than the evolutionary speed—thousands of times quicker.
Yet, it looks like we’re note only changing towards a better or bright future, but more going backwards and getting beaten up by primal instincts. Everywhere, the right extremists are gaining power these days.
This is not the first time in history this happened. We only see when we look holistically. Every few hundred years, the history repeats, a bit differently each time (that’s what makes it interesting too). But the underlying approach or events are the same.
