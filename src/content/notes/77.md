**_Connection before content!_**

As a meeting facilitator, your first job is connecting people before presenting any content. Focus on ice breakers at first. Connect people to each other as deep as possible.

Connection works best when people are face-to-face. If you’re hosting a workshop, use card games like [Ask Deep Questions](https://www.jankeck.com/product/adq-single/) or [We! Connect Cards](https://weand.me/product/we-connect-cards/).
