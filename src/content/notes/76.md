In recent years (2021-2024), the CTO role expanded from mostly operations to a business-driven approach.

CTOs are now expected to know how to run a business, including finance, product management and strategy, and people transformation.

The most significant impact of this change requires CTOs to do more on people transformation, structure and roles, managing and skilling up talent, hiring, and transforming processes.
