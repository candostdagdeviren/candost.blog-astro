![Circles of Influence](/images/content/notes/circles_of_influence.png)

In the circle of concern, there are many things over which you have no influence or control, such as economic changes, industry shifts, etc. This is the biggest group.

In the circle of influence, you can work with others like your peers and influence direction. You still donâ€™t get the result by doing things in the way you need or want, but you can influence them.

In the circle of control, you have things like how you communicate your thoughts, [think about things and perceive them](/notes/44/). They are all within your control.

Many people think they can influence their circle of concern. Almost everyone worries about any changes in the outer circle. However, there is not much they can do!
