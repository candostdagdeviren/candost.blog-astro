When we have values that define our personality, we always act accordingly. So, our values are actually limiting us. For example, if we value friendship, we will never yell at our friends, even if we really want it. If we value kindness, we will never tell a person that we hate them and never want to see them again because these are against our values. Besides the good sides of having values, having them limits us. Having no value enables us to be curious and discover new things in life. When we set a new value, we set a new identity that we will try to fit in any chance.

Good values are a good direction in life for better structure and time. However, knowing the side effects and being aware of the limiting behavior is eye-opening. It pushes us to be more careful and mindful of our identities and choices.
