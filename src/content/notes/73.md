The things we read shape how we see the world. The books, articles, or newspapers we read are the words of others; they open someone else’s world. If we’re not careful of what we consume, we may let immoral or trivial ideas affect us. Especially when we’re writing—[shaping our thoughts](/why-is-writing-important/)—others’ ideas will influence ours. And in turn, our text will influence our readers.
The information we receive every day also comes at a cost. Selective learning is the challenge of our modern world. We can’t, and shouldn’t, turn all the information we receive into a piece of knowledge. We have to be picky and discard 99% of the information around us, especially what people call [the latest ones](/no-more-debate-with-latest-or-daily-news/). Then, we must discard the 99% of the remaining 1%. Only the remaining ideas will be worth knowing.
