When you need to make a fast decision as a group, you can host lightning decision jam sessions. Phrase the problems you’re facing in “How Might We (HMW)” format, and ask everyone to write their answers silently into post-its. Then everyone puts their post-its to the wall and we prioritize the solutions and talk about them one by one.
