Confrontational cultures such as Russia and the Netherlands drive the confrontation with honesty. They are openly honest about things, and the situation derives from their culture.

Only you can be honest with yourself if you are honest with others. That's where other cultures lack. When a person tries to be in harmony with the group and avoid conflicts, they think the drive to succeed with the group. It's sometimes true, as we also see in Japan. However, understanding ourselves requires being honest with ourselves. Being honest with ourselves demands being honest with others, even if we have to confront them.
