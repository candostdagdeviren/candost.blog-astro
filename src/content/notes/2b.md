Writing is boring. Sometimes, when you start writing, there are many voices and thoughts that pop up in your head. They distract you by saying check social media, did you turn off the oven, or what should you eat at dinner. Think as if these thoughts are coming from small mice. Pick one of them from the tail. Put them in a jar and close the lid. Do it for all. Then imagine a volume knob in all these jars. Turn them all at once. Listen for a minute and turn them off. Go back to writing the first draft.
