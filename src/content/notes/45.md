## Entity-Trap Anti-Pattern

Creating entity managers to perform CRUD operations is not architectural thinking, and the result is not architecture. These operations can be easily handled by frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, NakedObjects, or Isis. Mapping from a database to a server doesn't need a full-blown architecture. Incorrectly identifying database relationships as workflows is called an entity trap, and it's an anti-pattern.
