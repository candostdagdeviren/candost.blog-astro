As a leader, your name should be attached to good things so that people will like you and follow you more. Not only good things but good people, too. When presenting or talking with others, be careful with what you are attaching yourself to. If you’re known as the person of bad news or challenging or annoying questions, you won’t go [too far](/notes/76/). Try to find the balance between looking good and staying authentic. [You shouldn’t lose authenticity](/notes/6/) or avoid [accountability](/notes/31/). Yet, you also shouldn’t form images in people’s minds about you that are related to negative things or people who don’t have a good reputation.
