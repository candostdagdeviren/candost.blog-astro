Whenever you are stuck with writing a story or when you don't know where to start a topic, write a letter to either a friend or a loved one. Letters are very casual, and their nature helps to ease the stress around writing. Talking to a friend also helps you remember many details because there is no one watching you over your shoulder.

When you write to a friend, it also includes authenticityâ€”writing to an audience nudges you to have a certain voice and style in writing and to keep that. But when you write a casual letter to a friend, you write with your whole being, as whoever you are.
