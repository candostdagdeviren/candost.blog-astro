A selfish goal is unattainable. When you want people to love you, and if you try forcing your way in, you’ll never be loved. But only when you want to [learn more about others](/notes/20i/) and [be genuinely curious](/notes/20h/), you’ll be loved as a by-product. [Self-forgetfulness will bring that as a by-product](/notes/30e/)—the same for acquiring knowledge. If you [aim to learn more](/notes/65/), [you’ll never learn](/notes/7c/). You’ll gain knowledge when you love a topic and [immerse yourself in it](/notes/30c/). You only get what you want when you [don’t focus on it directly, but do it indirectly](/notes/38a/).
