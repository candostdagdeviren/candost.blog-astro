Take the first step to share feedback. [The rule of reciprocation](/notes/30d1/) can play a big role when you want to get feedback, too. Especially for the positive feedback, take the extra time to provide it in the most visible way. This favor will get its return when you need feedback, too. While the other person thanks for the feedback, don’t just discard it by saying, “You’re welcome” or “No problem at all,” use the opportunity to enforce the rule of reciprocation by saying, “If our positions are reversed, I’m sure you’d do the same.”
When [giving feedback](21.md) to direct reports or mentees, [ask](6.md) what they could have done differently in a given situation. Ask them about [what they learned](33a.md) instead of starting with giving feedback.

This will allow them to think independently before receiving any suggestions and will help them learn more than they would when hearing someone else’s feedback.
