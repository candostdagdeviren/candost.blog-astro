When you deal with "us vs. them" conflicts, [listen to the people](/notes/53d/) but do not trust their judgment. The conflict will create [unconscious bias](/notes/44b/) toward the other side. Gather facts and meet with individuals to [understand their problems and perceptions](/notes/44/). Drill down into the root problem: often, it's [an unaddressed need of someone](/notes/41b2/) that the other person isn't seeing. Find and address it.
