In a dinner with a colleague, we talked about psychology in leadership. They were going to therapy and told me the impact of group therapy (I never had one): you see yourself through the eyes and stories of others. When you listen to someone else, it makes you think about yourself and how you relate to their story and how you had similar experiences in your life, and how you interpret your own stories. Reflexivity is a known concept of psychology and is widely known in the scientific community.
