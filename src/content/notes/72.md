In my experience, my Moonlander keyboard was broken, and I asked for support to see what they could do. Even though my keyboard was out of warranty, they sent a replacement unit for free. Now, I feel indebted to them and started writing a Moonlander review blog post. They solved my needs in a very customized way.

This rule is so strong and instinctually known by many sellers they always use it. For example, we have various stalls we go to nearby farmer’s markets. And they always add one or two gifts without us asking. Later on, we found out that we went there even more and started buying some other products, too. While they are easily exploiting the rule, I’m happily going there because every time, I get yet another gift.
