Imposter syndrome has many drawbacks. It can prevent us from being seen as strong people. But it also has advantages that can help us become better people and leaders.

Being an imposter motivates us to work harder. When we feel like we are cheating or our knowledge is insufficient, we work more to catch up.

It motivates us to work smarter. We're more inclined to change our opinions. If we believe we're not going to win, we have nothing to lose; therefore, we rethink our approach.

It makes us better learners. When we doubt our knowledge, we're more open to learning from others.
