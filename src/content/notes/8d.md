Don't be afraid of asking questions. Ask all of your questions to understand clearly. You are not only learning by asking but also helping the other to learn the basic facts, key details, or most practical aspects better. Also, when people try to answer questions, they realize their knowledge gaps and spend the effort to fill them so they can answer the question better.
