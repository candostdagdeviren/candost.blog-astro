FOMO is selfish. It means that you must taste all experiences and always seek the newest, shiniest thing. It focuses on your experience. It spreads you too thin. You become a dopamine addict by tasting and trying everything. You canâ€™t go deep into a specific topic because you say a lot of yeses and sacrifice your time with shallowness. You miss a lot for one big overwhelming yes, which can only be gained by [saying a lot of noes to trivial things](/notes/52a/).
