Establishing [authority](/notes/9d/) with command doesn’t work; it generates resentment. Building authority demands [showing vulnerability](/notes/7/), accepting failure, and building trust. Then, people will follow the authority even more. The same applies to authoritative products (full 5-star ratings are too good to be true).

  - [If you don’t see any downsides in someone’s arguments, how can you trust them](/notes/69/)?
