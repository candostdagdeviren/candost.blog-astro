People follow authority [without knowing](/notes/20d/). The authority doesn’t even have to be an expert in the field. They follow fake authorities, such as an actor with a lab coat playing a doctor role in advertisements, influencing people’s health decisions. People confuse expertise with authority signs. Titles also give clues about authority that make people follow them without considering expertise. I observe this at work, too. People sometimes follow what I’m saying even though I am not an expert in the area—just because I’m a manager.

  - [Accountability culture ensures](/notes/31/) that expertise is separated from authority.
  - When someone writes a book about a topic, it doesn’t mean they are right. The book gives them authority; however, [it may not be the reality](/notes/69/)—the same [applies to LLMs](/notes/69a/); they are not the authority.
  - When listening to investment advice, [be mindful](/notes/80/) about who advises you.
  - To establish authority, [some vulnerability has to be visible first](/notes/33b/).
