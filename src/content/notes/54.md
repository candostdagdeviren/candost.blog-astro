Creating an open culture starts with listening to people and addressing their problems. Many companies do neither. Some companies try addressing problems, but as they are not listening, they usually bring solutions that don't solve the problem at all.

To understand what people need and which problems they have, do regular morale check-ins and surveys. Keep it simple and ask one question. Do it monthly.

Read every question and really answer all of them, address the problems. Publish all results, comments, and answers to everyone. Don't read the survey results alone; as a leader, it will be an emotional roller coaster; you will need some other people (probably leaders) around you while reading.
