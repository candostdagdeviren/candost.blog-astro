By using E.coli bacteria, the scientists observe the evolution with an experiment. E. coli bacteria can multiply multiple times a day. In the experiment, they populate E. coli batteries every day for 36 years while keeping their environment exactly the same (using the same solution). After 20+ years or so, E.coli bacteria surprisingly started to consume Citrus (it was in the environment from the beginning, but batteries never consumed it as a food source; they always used Glucose) as a food source. Over the years, tiny mutations in their DNA have led to a big difference in the bacteria.

What we learn from this experiment is also in another direction. We say that the earth and the universe are always changing, and therefore, we, humans, change as well. But the change happens even when our environment is exactly the same. Change is inevitable.
