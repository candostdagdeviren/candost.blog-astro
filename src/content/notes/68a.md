The craft of leadership and [management](/notes/3/) lies in metacognition. Not only leadership but [decision-making](/notes/19/) in general. The right decisions will always be tricky, but real progress will come from [reflecting on how we thought before](/notes/31d/) and looking for ways to improve. Metacognition, as a concept, means thinking about thinking or above thinking. The wiseness, or knowledge, comes from one’s progress on metacognition. It’s also required in relationships, [higher-level jobs](/notes/11/) (as decisions impact much more things), and a person’s self-perception. The best way to advance in metacognition is journaling.
