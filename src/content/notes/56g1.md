Organizations mistake collaboration as a good strategy and don't see its side effects. The effect of two teams collaborating on systems is sometimes invisible. Two teams collaborating can enforce "great teamwork," and leaders can cheer up this kind of style. Yet, when the collaboration is not on purpose, it's more harmful to the company. It creates communication overhead, blurs the responsibility lines, and decreases the transparency and clarity around ownership and responsibility.
