Having facilitating team interaction mode should be across the organization. I think Quality Engineering can work in this mode for some organizations for a certain period. They can coach other teams to increase the quality of the software. The same approach can be taken for DevOps to guide teams to improve their CI/CD pipelines at the beginning of the DevOps journey. This way, the organization gains the strength to build its tools.
