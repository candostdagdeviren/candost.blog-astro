[Vulnerability](/notes/7/) is not what you think. You don’t need to communicate every emotion inside. But, inside, you have to [let all of them out](/notes/52b/). [You have to face all of them by yourself](/notes/46/), [find all your feelings](/notes/68a/), [acknowledge them](/notes/46d1/), and name them. You shouldn’t do this outside as it might disturb or annoy others. However, you have to do this one way or another by yourself. Only then you can understand yourself and [make a better decision](/notes/80/).
