Great communicators are both the managers and a part of the feedback conversations, especially when they [receive feedback](/notes/40/). They take steps back, unstuck the conversation, and give it a pause or a direction for the conversation. These people are better suited for facilitating the discussions and are likely to [advance in their careers](/notes/8/). They have the [humility](/notes/7/) to admit how they contributed to the now-stuck conversation and can drive the conversation to a result.
