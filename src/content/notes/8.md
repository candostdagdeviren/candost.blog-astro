If you want to grow in your career, focus on the profession, not the title. Titles differ from company to company. Being a senior developer doesn't mean having the necessary knowledge or skills. In one company, you can be a senior. In another, you can be a junior. There is no universal definition of a senior developer. So, focus on growing yourself in the profession and experience.
