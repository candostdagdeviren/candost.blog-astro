Most strong emotions, such as fear, are caused by uncertainty and the unknown. Once trained, managing these emotions becomes simple (not easy). Training takes effort and time. Yet the steady one always heads to the chaos, knowing what to expect and finding an easier way out.

  - [Fear is your body's call to action](/notes/30b2/). Training fear teaches you when to listen and when to override.
  - [Metacognition](/notes/68a/) is how we observe our own fear and uncertainty; you can't train what you don't notice.
  - [Training puts you through discomfort](/notes/46d1/). Acknowledge weaknesses rather than hiding them.
  - [Self-discipline](/notes/52a4/) is the long-term character investment that makes training stick.
  - [Understanding why you make decisions](/notes/80/) is a practical way to train when fear or bias is driving you.
