Although society is more individualistic than ever and day by day becomes more individualistic, you need [others’ assistance to fight your inner struggles](/notes/20l/). Some people have God to fill this gap and use it to fight prejudices, selfishness, [greed](/notes/38a/), and [pride](/notes/52a2/), and they develop self-compassion and individual will. These inner forces are too strong to fight alone. You have to find outside help or hope that it will give you the best. These can be [cultural traditions](/notes/63/) as well. The thing is that they have to educate your heart and build values, and show what to feel in certain circumstances.
