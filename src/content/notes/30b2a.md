When you’re changing rules (as a leader) and people lose access to certain things, create [a proper decision-making strategy](/notes/3a/) so they don’t rebel too much or become unsatisfied at work. Try to understand how you can control people’s emotions and develop strategies for situations that can go wrong.

- **Related Note(s):**
  - [If you’re removing access to a perk or benefit, communicate clearly](/notes/32b/), [explain the reasons clearly](/notes/20c/) and avoid leaving people uncertain, as this will strengthen their emotions.
- [Create an open culture](/notes/54/) to hear criticism.
