Having an accountability cadence helps people develop a sense of ownership. When people don't hold themselves accountable, they focus on individual improvements and get stuck there.

Forming a cadence for accountability helps extract learning, anticipate future blockers, and create ownership. Putting it into a cadence (like weekly) helps form the culture. If you're having accountability and responsibility problems, start regularly asking about people's commitment and how their commitment from the previous cadence is going.

When people publicly commit, they try harder to make that commitment happen, regardless of the topic.
