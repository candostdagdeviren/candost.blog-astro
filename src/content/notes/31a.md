Having an accountability cadence helps people to form ownership sense. When people don't hold themselves accountable, they move their focus to individual improvements and get stuck there.

Forming a cadence for accountability helps to extract learning, anticipate future blockers, and create ownership. Putting it into cadence (like weekly) helps to form the culture. If you're having accountability and responsibility problems, start regularly asking about people's commitment and how their commitment from the previous cadence is going.

When people publicly commit, they try harder to make that commitment happen, regardless of the topic.
