*“Without another’s loving care, none of us would have lived more than a few days.”* Although compassion begins within oneself, it is about caring for others’ problems ([not yours](/the-one-with-the-wrong-problem/)) and actively helping to resolve them without expecting anything in return and without any self-interest. The benefits of compassion are gaining happiness and relief through others. Instead of [prioritizing our own goals](/seek-goals-that-will-change-how-you-live/) and happiness, it’s about putting others’ happiness first, knowing that greater happiness will increase the happiness of society, including our own. Compassion is what can bring [all humans together](/notes/93/) around a single entity, “we,” and destroy the fundamental [rivalry](/notes/90/) and hatred of us vs. them.
