The very first rule of building trust as a leader; do what you say, say what you do. Build authenticity. When you act differently than what you talk about, the people you are leading get confused. Confusion leads to frustration and conflicts between you and your employee.

Trust is something like insurance; you have to pay regular contributions to use it when you need it. When you act differently than what you talk about, you don't pay your regular contribution. Similar to insurance companies, employees will ask you to pay your debt in a meaningful time. Otherwise, you will lose the trust fully.
