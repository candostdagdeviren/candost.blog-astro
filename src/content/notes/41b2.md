You never know someone else’s story. When you find anyone difficult, [there is always an underlying story or reason](/notes/62b/). Some people don’t understand why they behave the way they do and are unaware of [their desires](/notes/7b/). [Try to learn](/notes/53d/) and [understand their story behind the scenes](/notes/44g3/).

For yourself: if you don’t know why you act in a certain way and what your underlying beliefs and reasons are, you won’t be able to change your behavior. [Discover](/notes/46h/) your [values](/notes/52/) and what you care about. Make them explicit to yourself.
