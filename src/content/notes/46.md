**If you can't make a decision, coach yourself as if you're doing it for a friend.**

The only face we don't see and cannot read is ours. We always think about our thoughts, feelings, and intentions. But we don't focus on how they impact our behavior and how others perceive it. On the other side of the equation, we always watch other people's behavior and guess their intentions. Whenever we see that their behavior is off from their intention, we can quickly point to it and even coach them. Applying a similar strategy to ourselves is trickier. That's why we need to coach ourselves more and more.

*The strategy:* Whenever we struggle with any life decision, we think of ourselves as someone else. Think of ourselves as one of our best friends who needs honest feedback. What would we recommend to them in that situation? Then we write down our answers and give a short timeframe before rereading them and deciding what to do.
