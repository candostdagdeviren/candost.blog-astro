Sometimes leadership introduce something and don't explain what they had considered as disadvantages of the change. They often talk about the pros of a new system without mentioning the cons clearly. This situation makes it very difficult to get the buy-in from people. When executive leadership and HR introduce new systems, they have to talk about disadvantages clearly so that people don't speculate on their importance. When it's not explained, people won't be able to weigh the costs properly as they don't either see the holistic picture or are not deep enough into the topic. Preventing people's speculations demands explaining both pros and cons together.
