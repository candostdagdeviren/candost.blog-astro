When our lives pass without contest, conflict, or friction, when our lives pass without success or merit, weâ€™re merely filling existence. Our lives become useless and purposeless. The person who [commits](/notes/38a1/), strives, conflicts, penetrates the hardship, [seeks the inconvenient](/notes/67/), and [crosses the ocean of difficulties](/notes/54d/) to build merit or succeed can say that they exist for good.
