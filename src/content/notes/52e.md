Before you speak (or write a message to someone), pass your message from three gates that ask these questions, as Rum√Æ said, "Is it true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?"
The first door eliminates the things your mind makes up.
The second door eliminates the thoughts that arise without a filter, the thoughts you have but don't contribute to the common good.
The third door ensures you don't break hearts with your words because once a heart is broken, it's impossible to repair it.
