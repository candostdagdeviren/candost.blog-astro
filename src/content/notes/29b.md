In uncertainty, don’t seek or move with a map but with a compass.
You need to be alert to your surroundings more than relying on external guidance. With a compass, you have a direction to go and must adjust yourself depending on what you find on the way. You have to discover the territory yourself. A map does not fully reflect the territory. Someone else’s path is written on the map, not yours.
