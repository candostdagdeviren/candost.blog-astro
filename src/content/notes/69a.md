The TV and search engines [made](/notes/68/) people think less. They killed [intellectual curiosity](/notes/30/). Constant access to information that nobody needs pushes people away from [fulfilling their curiosity by research](/notes/65/). LLM took this to another level. People trusting AI, the closed and opaque box, is [breaking society apart](/notes/63/) by [making people ignorant](/notes/38/). People don't [validate the information](/notes/64/) and follow it. They [form opinions without correct information](/notes/73/). LLM is revolutionary, and there is nothing that will stop it until it's too late. We should adopt LLM into our lives for sure. But should we trust? [Hell, no](/notes/67/)!
