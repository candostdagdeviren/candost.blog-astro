Tolerance and improving diverse living are not that difficult. They only require empathy. Putting ourselves in someone elseâ€™s shoes and trying to understand them already unites us as people. Moreover, if there are more diverse people in our neighborhood, we will unite with them more quickly and reduce or eliminate the prejudices we build in our heads because [we belong to a neighborhood](/notes/20n/). Once we have things in common, it becomes easier to unite and feel comfortable.

  - [Authority figures](/notes/9d/) must live in diverse neighborhoods. Often, they don't, and we face discrimination.
  - [Forming a neighborhood community](/notes/20l/) in which people share responsibilities helps build a diverse living.
