I've worked with people who want to bring money home and keep their passion for something else. This is entirely normal. Many people don't look to find meaning in their jobs. For them, it's just a job that enables them to live the way they want.

As leaders, our job is not to give them meaning in life at work. Our job is to understand each person's desire and motivation and create an environment where they can find their own meanings in their own ways.

Not everyone has to have a passion for work, and it's okay. If they still try their best and do that job well, there is no need for passion in these people.
