I used to think of [system design](/notes/48/) as being formed by technical and communicational patterns. However, everything around software teams and technical infrastructure affects the system design: offices, team distribution, CI/CD, organizational technology standards, and best practices. Even when we want to build microservices while everyone is in the same office, we will produce different designs than when everyone is distributed across multiple offices or works remotely.
