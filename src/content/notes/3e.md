Sharing status updates doesn't mean the team is collaborating. We need to organize our meetings to both communicate and collaborate. There can be certain meetings where we only communicate (such as daily stand-ups), but there must be someplace we collaborate (it doesn't have to be a meeting). Understanding what's collaboration and what's not is part of a manager's job, and they have to clearly define their expectations from the team and communication mediums.
