Simple ideas can prevent complicated problems. We often seek complex solutions because we want to stand out from the crowd. Simple ideas are available to everyone. They are often the first thing people learn. When we want to take an extra step, we search for complex answers. Yet, simple ideas not only solve but also prevent these problems from arising in the first place. They eliminate the complications right at the start. That's why we must seek simple ideas and embrace simplicity.
