Regular career check-ups and running experiments in various domains are great strategies. It's difficult to see things from the outside. We often have wrong perceptions about a job until we start doing it. For example, until I've become an engineering manager, I didn't know the importance of prioritization and the stress level that it produces. If I could have had more chances to try the profession, I might have chosen a different one.

We should have some checkpoints in our careers to evaluate how it's going.
