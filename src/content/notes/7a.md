Whenever you win a victory or succeed, [that’s the moment](/notes/62a/) you’re the most vulnerable. Your feelings of success blind you, and you underestimate luck’s role in your success. [That’s the moment](/notes/5a/) you make the biggest mistake. When you win, get yourself together, [reflect on your success](/notes/68/), and draw your strategy. [What brought you here might not bring you there](/notes/46c/). You have to evaluate your rhythm and your emotions. Don’t let your emotions rule you. They make you vulnerable. Be aware of them and control the situation while recognizing your feelings. Your next step should come from your head, not from your heart.
