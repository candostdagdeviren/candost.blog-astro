If you would like to improve your relationship with someone, compliment them on their good traits. Your compliment will open the doors for someone to like you. The compliment doesnâ€™t even have to be true.
But be careful when you give compliment to your boss. Try to do it via third person, like sharing your compliment with their assistant if they have one. On the other hand, when you receive a compliment, be aware of your bias toward liking the person and favouring them.
