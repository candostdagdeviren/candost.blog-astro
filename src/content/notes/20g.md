Increase your physical attractiveness when you work. People give more social advantages to the physically attractive. You should not only dress nicely but also take care of yourself. Exercise to stay in shape and take care of yourself. In your organization, you may not be required to dress nicely; people may go to work in their pajamas, but just being more chic brings you social advantage.
