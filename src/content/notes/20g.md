Increase your physical attractiveness when you work. People give more social advantage to the people who are physically attractive. You should only dress nicely, but also take care of yourself. Exercise to stay in shape and take care of yourself. In your organization, there maybe not a requirement to dress nicely; people may go to work with pyjamas but just being more chic brings you social advantage.
