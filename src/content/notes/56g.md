Sometimes, it looks like long-term collaboration is necessary between two teams that are both stream-aligned. But it doesn't fit into the collaboration team interaction mode framework (e.g., consumer and provider teams were meeting every week). Any friction between these teams should be avoided (if the goal is not discovery or innovation) because its cost will be high. I think organizations shouldn't have many teams in collaboration mode, although it is highly attractive to imagine collaborating teams closely.
