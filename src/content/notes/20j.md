When you want people who don’t know or like each other to work well together, [assign them tasks that require cooperation](/notes/24/). These tasks should not be achievable by only one side; they must utilize the skills and knowledge of both parties. Once you identify the perfect task, you’ll notice how both sides begin to appreciate each other—transforming rivalry into teamwork. A successful team or relationship hinges on accomplishing goals together. Likewise, [when you join a new team](/notes/3b/), [ask questions](/notes/3b1/), actively participate and collaborate with the group to foster camaraderie and achieve successful integration.
