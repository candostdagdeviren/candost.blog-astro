While doing things with others is already helpful in forming better relationships, doing things in synchronized movements like dancing or singing unites people even further. Doing synchronized activities brings people closer as they share the moment. Thatâ€™s why all national anthems are sung out loud together, and armies march in perfect synchronization. The same is true for teams. Team events that require synchronized acting or even acting only get people closer. They find a common ground and feel they belong.
