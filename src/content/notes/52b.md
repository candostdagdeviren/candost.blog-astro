Death is an unavoidable yet the most shunned concept in life. We live as we can escape from it. We don't think about it and continue our lives as if it is not there. The immortal feeling gives us entitlement.

Immortality, or fake immortality, prevents us from understanding whatever we do will stay in this world. At the same time, we work toward breaking this understanding. Many people want to leave something behind that will remind them long after they die.

Once we accept and always remember that we will die, we can choose not to give a fuck about many things. We can get rid of the entitlement and select our values correctly. Death keeps our focus on the important and valuable stuff. It gives us freedom.
