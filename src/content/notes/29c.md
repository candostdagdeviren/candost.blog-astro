How the world is a matter of [perception](/notes/46/). The way to achieving what we want lies on how we look at what's in front of us. A small success may [blind us](/notes/7a/) or display the truth with full-blown reality; a tiny problem might cause [unnecessarily swirling emotions](/notes/30b2/) or shows a new way to resolve—all matter of perception. An obstacle on our way can be a detriment or an advantage; it's us who defines it.

  - [We are weakest when we're strongest](/notes/7a/)—success blinds us and we underestimate luck. The same event can blind one person while another sees it with ruthless objectivity.
  - [Choosing good values and metrics](/notes/30c/) defines our perspective and perception of life; it determines whether we see a glass half-full or half-empty.
  - [The media distorts reality](/notes/30b3/) with extraordinary people, creating misperception. Accepting reality as it is helps us focus on the present.
  - [Coaching ourselves](/notes/46/) is difficult because we perceive ourselves differently from how others perceive us.
  - [Our common humanity](/notes/44g3/) pushes us to avoid pain and obstacles and choose the easy way.
  - [Distractions](/notes/2b/) are obstacles on your way.
  - [Doubts](/notes/46d/) are your mind’s obstacles.
