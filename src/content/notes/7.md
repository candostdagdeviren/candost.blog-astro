When I think about managers I've worked with, the best ones were the ones who say, "I don't know" or "I was wrong." They knew their weaknesses in the team or, in general, in the company. Instead of hiding them, they embraced them and allowed others to fill the gap in their knowledge. They also knew their strengths. They were confident in some areas they knew they were good at. However, they also accepted that they were wrong more, even in their confidence area. They were always open to learning. Now, there is a term for their behavior: confident humility. That's what they had.
