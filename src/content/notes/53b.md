When people perform well in their jobs, they earn autonomy. These people usually level up in their jobs. Some leaders neglect to take a look at these people's careers just because they are performing and don't want to break them, and they trust these employees. The manager starts to become absentee. Even though these people perform well in their jobs, they need more partners. Absentee managers are on the opposite side of micromanaging. We need balanced managers who can be partners with the best-performing employees, listen to their problems and have dedicated time with them, and even do the work together with them (even if it requires them to get their hands dirty). Otherwise, the best performers will feel lost, unguided, and uninformed.
