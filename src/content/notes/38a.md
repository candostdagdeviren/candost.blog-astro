Most of the time, we try to change our habits, starting with outcomes. We focus on what we want to achieve. However, if we reverse our view and focus on who we want to become, we see real change. For example, when we want to quit smoking, and someone offers us a cigarette, instead of saying, "No, I'm trying to quit", we say, "No, I'm not a smoker." Instead of saying, "I'm a person who wants this behavior," we say, "I'm a person who is this." Once we do this, we start doing things related to this personality. We start taking pride that is our driving power to maintain the habit. We start following habits that fit our identity.
