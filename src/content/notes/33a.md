You need to put your money where your mouth is. If you want to grow your people, don't just send them to conferences; tell them to read books. Lead by example. Otherwise, no one will follow. Put awards for people who grow. Promotion is not the only way to reward people. Give swags and awards; invest in these because your company will grow only when people grow. If you want people to read books, pay them to read books. Either tell them to spend an hour every week or pay extra rewards for reading.

If you're not putting your money into the things you ask people to do, no one will follow.
