Similar to knowledge acquiring, being certain and pursuing to be certain makes you more uncertain. The more you read and learn, the less you know. The more uncertain you are, the more you are open to learning and changing.

The more you are open to being uncertain, the more you feel comfortable when you find something you don't know.

When you are certain, you limit yourself and put borders around your thoughts. Certainty is the enemy of open thinking.

When we put everything in a certain way, there is no joy in it. The joy, learning, and growth come from enough uncertainty and being open to new things.
