The feedback has its meaning when it's timely. Positive feedback usually feels like a pat on the shoulder, and we usually think that we can do it at any time. However, positive reinforcement works better when it's delivered right after the desired behavior. When we reward people at the moment they do something good, they directly connect it to the behavior, and that behavior solidifies. When the reward is late, it loses its meaning, and we begin to have a hard time justifying achievements.
