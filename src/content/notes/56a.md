I used to think designing systems and architectures started within the team. Engineers in the team usually don't have a holistic picture of the organization, and they design systems with their best intentions and using their understanding of constraints. After reading [Team Topologies](/books/team-topologies-book-review-summary-and-notes/), I learned—or let's say, enlightened—that designing systems starts from designing teams; as Conway's Law states, "Organizations are destined to create software constrained by how teams communicate with each other." Before reading it, I thought that software engineering leaders didn't have to be technical because leadership is not a technical job. However, the same leaders create organizational structures and, therefore, decide how the architecture of systems will be shaped. Now I think they have to have a technical background to understand how their decision will reflect on the system design. Or they have a technical person on the table while designing the organization.
