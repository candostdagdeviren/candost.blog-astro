For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases. The motion means the intermediaries win more as they take fees, taxes, and deduct costs from shareholders' value.

- **Related Note(s):**
  - This is the mathematical proof of [minimizing costs and trading](/notes/97/). More trading = more motion = fewer returns.
  - [Capitalism creates wealth](/notes/96/), but motion transfers that wealth from investors to intermediaries without creating new value.
  - [Long-term thinking](/notes/52a4/) means minimizing motion. Patience is profitable; activity is expensive.
  - Just like [compound interest works positively](/notes/14/), motion compounds negatively through repeated fees and taxes.
