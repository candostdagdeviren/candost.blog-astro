When someone gets compliment on something they are doing good, they try to perfect it. For example, if an engineer writing a good Pull Request description 80% of the time, compliment on how they care about doing these things that bring clarity and thank them. You’ll see that they will start doing it 100% of the time. Compliments help perfect someone’s occasionally good behavior. A small tip: don’t compliment on the behavior, but on the trait. Be genuine and find compliments the person will live up to. Don’t exploit it.
