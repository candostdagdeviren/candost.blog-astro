In small favors that are often invisible, we give a lot of automatic responses. If someone cuts the line, we become frustrated, but if they first ask to pass us while giving a weak reason, we give them the place. The reasons don’t have to be strong and logical. Any illogical reason also works as long as there is a reason tied to the request.
