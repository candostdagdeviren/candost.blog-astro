Homes are sacred places that belong to the closest family. When we feel the closest with someone, it is the time we share residence. When we invite friends to our homes, they are already one step ahead in uniting with us. When we want to get even closer, we can involve them in setting the table during dinners. It shows that (and make them feel like) they are part of the family as they help. Sharing some chores belongs to co-residents and family. With a small gesture, we tell them we see the guests as part of the family. They also begin being comfortable and share their feeling. That feeling remains for a long time.
