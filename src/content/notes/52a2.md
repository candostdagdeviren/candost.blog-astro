Staying humble is knowing that [almost nothing is in our control](/notes/46g/) and can change in a moment. Most of our lives are outside of our control; [changes are driven by others](/notes/30e/) in society, such as a boss at work, a politician, and even delays in the metro. Pride is thinking that we can control them all. Itâ€™s denying the truth and sitting in a creator of life chair. We are not the authors of our own lives. Neither has a divine power. Accepting that we have almost no control requires destroying this pride and breaking the delusion.
