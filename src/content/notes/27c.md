> "If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment."

Smokers have many cues around them. They always have a reason to light up a cigarette. People cannot form new habits or stop the bad ones because most people live in an environment someone else designed for them, either their parents, partner or family. To make the habits more consistent, design your own environment. If you can't, try a new environment. Building new habit is easier in a new environment. That is why we behave differently on holidays or elsewhere than at home.
