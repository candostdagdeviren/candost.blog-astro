Many job descriptions, company websites, and leaders mention “having a high bar in performance.” Everyone talks about it, but few define it. Nobody is transparent and doesn’t explain what they think. Defining the high bar isn’t just an intellectual exercise—it’s about setting expectations for ourselves and those we work with.

I like clarity. So, here is my attempt to define the high bar—at least mine, at least the one I keep for myself, and the one I apply to people reporting to me.

To me, **having a high bar in performance means constantly living with and demonstrating two key traits: an ownership mindset and an intrinsic drive for continuous improvement.**

## Ownership Mindset: The Foundation

I [believe](/strong-ownership-culture-in-a-team/) that people are motivated and driven by purpose when they own, _truly own_, what they do. **Truly owning means taking full responsibility for all aspects of the work.** It’s not like Gollum’s ownership of the ring in The Lord of The Rings but more like Sam’s mission of helping Frodo. Sam is driven with a purpose. He [bears all the burdens on the road](/learnings-on-dealing-with-ambiguity/), sometimes more than Frodo. Even when everything is against him, he doesn’t give up and saves Frodo on various occasions. What he shows everyone is a true ownership mindset.

When people own the idea, put in the work, and drive themselves to the results, remarkable things happen. Every time I see someone owning a piece of work, I see the pride in their eyes when it reaches its end. They meticulously consider all the details, eliminate various risks, work hard and finally achieve an outcome.

Similarly, [they own the failure](/dont-take-responsibility-more-and-stop-blaming/), too. If anything fails, they never say, “Ah, this failed because of that person or this or that.” They approach with, “_This failed; it’s on me and here are the things I will do differently from now on to ensure it doesn’t happen again._”

But the ownership alone isn’t enough—it must be paired with a relentless desire for improvement.

## Relentless Improvement: The Second Pillar

The second pillar of the high bar is the unending desire to improve—known as the growth mindset. It involves **a hunger for improvement and a curiosity to explore** [**unknown unknowns**](/notes/19a/), which keeps the person “awake” until all are discovered.

They rarely settle into a comfort zone at anything; **they continually seek more—not for the sake of impressing others or for any external reason, but out of a genuine intrinsic drive.** This is not because someone encouraged them to learn (_though this can be a valid reason, too_), but rather because, even without guidance, they actively, consistently, and [relentlessly pursue opportunities](/what-hades-the-game-had-taught-me/) to get better at what they do.

They also do it methodologically. **They focus on getting the fundamentals right and strong, adjusting their learning techniques, and looking for ways to increase their overall productivity and speed of learning, concentrating on the holistic picture and specifics of what they do simultaneously.** They keep their attention on the outcome and try to get rid of small frictions that prevent them from reaching it.

I once worked with an engineer who mastered every shortcut in their tools only to [eliminate distractions](/decisions-that-remove-other-decisions/) while working and focus on achieving outcomes. They were annoyed when they needed to stop and find out how to use their tool. They paused, took note of that, and the next time we worked together on something, I saw them already using a new shortcut. They didn’t brag to others about how many shortcuts they knew. They were focused on learning and adjusting everything in their work to become better and faster. They were humble.

## Humility

Both the ownership and growth mindsets demand humility. **People with a high bar accept setbacks and take full accountability for them.** They endure reality as it is, know that there are things to improve, and never show off what they have done while still celebrating their achievements.

**Humility keeps them grounded as they strive for a higher standard.** It allows them to admit and study their mistakes, [seek feedback even when nobody is giving it](/maximizing-personal-growth-by-understanding/), learn from others, and [stay open to new ideas](/krishnamurti-and-seneca-on-freeing-the-mind/). Humility prevents their ambition from turning into arrogance.

This humility also [shapes how they approach their work](/a-life-without-problems-the-happiness/)—not with burnout-causing hustle but with a sustainable focus.

## Not a Hustle Culture; It’s a Long Term Game

**Hustle culture glorifies overwork, but people with a high bar know better—they play the long game and avoid working more than necessary.** The growth mindset, which involves adjusting every specific detail of work to prevent distractions, focuses on eliminating distractions and maximizing impact with _just enough_ effort.

These people work intensely when they focus but take breaks to be ready for the next round. They aim to [keep their pace and sustain it for a very long time](/seek-goals-that-will-change-how-you-live/), leaving the [_compounding effect_](https://www.mpfa.org.hk/en/mpf-investment/principles-of-fund-investment/compounding-effect) to play its role.

They know they must sustain their energy and momentum because the moment they touch the high bar, the bar rises—all the time—because they set the bar higher themselves. They show everyone that the high bar is an intrinsic motive, not an external one, as organizations claim.

Yet, some people need guidance to unlock this approach and understand how the high bar works. That’s where managers or coaches come in.

## The Role of The Manager

Sometimes, as a manager, I hear that I am constantly raising the bar, which may make people feel like they are always trying to do more, meet an impossible task, and fulfill unattainable expectations—making them feel like [Sisyphus](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Sisyphus). However, **my goal isn’t just to push people harder—it’s to help them realize their potential by gradually raising expectations based on their capabilities.**

When I begin working with someone new, I start by observing where they are—how they approach their craft and what they’re capable of. Once the evaluation is done, we put a high bar _together_—high enough that it is not impossible to reach but definitely requires a good amount of effort.

When I see them touching that bar, I raise it _only if_ _they don’t_. Because my job is to show people what they are capable of. They might not know their potential, but my job is to show them what is possible when _they aim right_ and _try their best_. **Incrementally raising expectations helps them build confidence while unlocking their potential step by step.**

Of course, there is a catch. Once I discover that their bar is lower than what I would have expected at their level (according to the [organization’s career-level expectations](/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-career-ladders-and-frameworks/)), the improvement steps can become a big challenge. However, we set the bar low first. Once we reach that lower bar, we start increasing again.

**Once a person develops this intrinsic desire and learns to work to a high bar, they unlock a new world—a journey to becoming a corps d’elite.**

Ultimately, people with a high bar redefine expectations—for themselves and [everyone around them](/passing-down-the-experience/). They don’t just meet standards; they set new ones and inspire others to rise alongside them.

And that’s how I define a high bar in performance.
