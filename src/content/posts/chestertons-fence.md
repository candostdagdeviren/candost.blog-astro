That’s what many people agreed on without asking a straightforward question: Why is there a fence here in the first place? What’s the rationale behind putting a fence?

That fence is called Chesterton’s Fence. If you remove it, Chesterton will cry. Less jokingly, [Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton) (writer and philosopher who died in 1936) invites us to think about the rationale behind an earlier decision and take action only after we understand why there was a decision in the first place. It goes even beyond and encourages us to practice second-order thinking: thinking about the consequences of the consequences of our decisions. (it’s not a typo, yes, consequences of consequences of decisions).

Everyone can do the first-order thinking: if I do X, the result will be Y. Only a few considers the consequences of Y because that consideration often requires greater effort, and we don’t have time.

### What can we do as leaders?

While making a decision that is not minor, we can stop momentarily and practice second-order (or even third-order) thinking. This strategy helps us to learn why a specific (and seemingly stupid) decision is made earlier, and then, only then, we can safely change it or conclude that they were wrong.
