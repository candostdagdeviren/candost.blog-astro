Every morning, I wake up around 5-5:30, even on weekends and holidays. Till 9:00, I don't have any routine differentiating working days or weekends. That means I don't have weekdays or weekend concepts in my mornings. When people hear me saying, "I don't see any day differently from the other. Days are in a continuation. Why would I treat any day differently?" they find it weird and difficult to understand. Here, I want to explain why.

Weekends are often considered as the time to sleep more and do things that don't get a chance during the week (e.g., going out on Friday and sleeping in on Saturday). This concept helps people relax and enjoy life. I agree. It feels good to leave the routine life and do things differently. Recovering the energy that's depleted during the working days is crucial so we can _survive_ one more week. And here, I tend to differ from many.

Concepts like weekdays, weekends, and anniversaries are not for me. They don't bring anything to my life other than breaking [my rituals (not _routines_)](https://candost.blog/the-power-of-ritualization-rituals-vs-routines/). Let me explain why I see each day the same.

The problem lies in putting weekday/weekend concepts at the center of our lives.

If I have a workout plan centered around going to the gym (ideally) five times a week, I have to stick to the weekly concept. I can regularly go on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday and plan my routines based on weeks; then, the program gets broken if I skip one day. Let's say I skipped Tuesday. Which workout am I going to do on Wednesday, then? Wednesday's original one or Tuesday's workout that I skipped?

However, if the [focus is on continuing the program](https://candost.blog/goals-and-existence) regardless of the week concept, I can continue where I left off. If I need to skip the gym on Sunday, I can continue with my Sunday workout plan the next day I'm at the gym.

The other factor is my sleep, [the center of life](https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/toolkit-for-sleep). As we must sleep every day, focusing on circadian rhythm is the real deal. Sleeping in on weekends breaks my body and brain. Then during the week, I try to recover and can't get my shit together.

Weekday and weekend concepts are brought by someone in the past to help with _something._ And they are helpful for various things (e.g., workdays are useful for everyone working on the same day). But they aren't helpful for many other things. Instead of forcing myself to follow the process, I want to leverage them only when they are beneficial.

I still work on weekdays and spend time with family and friends on weekends, but I don't sleep in on Saturday mornings just because there is nothing to do (and there are always some things to do). I wake up at the same time on Sunday as on Wednesday because my sleep routine is more important to me than the "Friday night fun," and sleeping in is worse for my health. Of course, this is not a rule I must obey; there will be exceptions. And they have to remain an exception.
