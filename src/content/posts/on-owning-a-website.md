Something is different about owning a website—a palace on the web. Unlike a car or a house, unlike other hobbies, a website exists in a subtle space between the private and public spheres. Though you create it, nurture it, and spend countless hours making it beautiful and functional, it lives out there on its own. The magical part is that strangers across the globe (many people you will never see in your life) can leave their thoughts on the pages, creating connections impossible in other creative hobbies.

## The Freedom of Creation

A personal website brings freedom. A sculptor can also say the same before they hit a chisel with a hammer to shape a block of marble, or a painter with a clean brush and endless color palette to use on an empty canvas. Yet, none gives the freedom the website provides.

On a website, mistakes are replaceable and fixable; nothing is permanent. A mischievous strike on an almost finished sculpture or a degraded color on a paint after it has been dried can’t be undone or changed. But on a website? Even after a significant amount of coding and designing a website, everything can still change. Not only the design, but your creative content can change at any time too. If a post written years ago doesn’t reflect your thinking anymore, you can revise it or retire it with a note explaining how you have changed.

## The Flexibility of Presentation

A personal website brings flexibility for presentation. Today, you may create a chronological blog; tomorrow, you can revamp the whole website and turn it into a carefully curated [knowledge garden](/notes/). Today, you can design a static website (like this one); tomorrow, you can evolve it to an interactive experience.

The possibilities are endless. Unlike physical creative works, which are frozen at the moment of completion, a website breathes and changes—sometimes drastically, sometimes subtly—reflecting the growth as both creator and person.

## The Connection and Conversation

A personal website brings connections across so many boundaries. When an artist produces a piece, they rarely hear others’ thoughts if they don’t put the piece on social media. Their work is mostly visible in the world of silent viewers. But a website creates an ongoing dialogue.

A piece written five minutes ago can be read by someone on the other side of the world. Imagine you share your personal grief on your blog before you go to sleep. Someone else, through the night, finds comfort in your words and shares their story in the comments. Or a piece you wrote to solve a technical problem can help others again and again, or the one you couldn’t solve can be solved by someone else’s suggestion in the comments.

These connections have a different quality than those formed on social media. They are centered around ideas [rather than driven by the number of likes](/there-are-no-analytics-on-this-blog/). That’s why [an idea written five years ago can still find an audience and restart a conversation just like it was published a moment ago](/speaking-writing-and-high-quality-ideas/).

## The Immortality of Ideas

A personal website gives an opportunity for survival. Unlike physical artifacts that decay or require careful preservation, digital thoughts can be perfectly replicated, backed up, preserved, and even later improved.

 I built my own website first using Jekyll. I didn’t like the design that much and moved to Hugo, then to Ghost and later Astro, each time with a different design while preserving the pieces I’ve written.

The only thing that has a chance to survive is your ideas that fill the website. Although you must update your website’s infrastructure due to ever-changing technology, your ideas, thoughts, memories stay the same. A website provides intellectual immortality.

## The Responsibility of Maintenance

Within all these opportunities and freedom, there is one downside: maintenance. A personal website carries a maintenance burden. A book doesn’t need any further effort from its author once published; a paint only needs occasional dusting. But the website needs ongoing attention.

Even keeping it alive without adding anything new demands time and devotion. The technical infrastructure keeps changing under the hood. If you don’t choose the simplest and plainest approach, you must keep it updated. This is why we have seen the rise of services like Substack, Medium, Ghost, and WordPress, offering solutions around maintaining a website.

While keeping the website alive needs time, the real cost comes from indulging in the pursuit of perfection. Making perfect websites shouldn’t be the goal unless it’s for an artistic approach. Otherwise, it should be about the freedom. Having a space to write and organize thoughts, artifacts, information and documenting the journey is the reason it exists. Many people, including me, lose a lot of time trying to make the perfect website, forgetting its real purpose.

## Verdict

The website is ultimately more than just a collection of pages; it’s a reflection of self. It reveals who we are through content and how we present the content. It combines the narrative elements of writing, visual components of design, the structural thinking of information architecture, opening a true place of the mind to visitors around the globe.

Yes, it requires effort to build and [commitment to maintain](/notes/25d/). But there is nothing like it; no other medium evolves with you, gathers connections around the world and preserves thoughts. That’s why it’s worth having.
