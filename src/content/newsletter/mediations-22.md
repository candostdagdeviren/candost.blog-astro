You probably heard the word globalization countless times. But these days, after decades of pursuing globalization, we're chasing deglobalization.

Rather than simply being the opposite of globalization, deglobalization is a deliberate movement toward less connected societies characterized by powerful nation-states prioritizing local solutions and border controls over global institutions and free movement.

Following the Industrial Revolution and World Wars, there was a shift toward increased interconnectedness between countries and culture, when institutions like the European Union were founded.

Now, the time is changing again toward a more closed society—countries are leaning toward becoming self-sufficient as the fear of "losing authenticity" and "losing the race" becomes stronger.

However, the caveat is that it's not easy, especially due to the Internet and technological advancements. Anyone can still learn what's going on on the other side of the globe in a second, even when the borders are closed.

Right-wing deglobalization populists are afraid of losing control due to the Internet. However, they still have a means of control: migration policies.

While countries attempt to close their borders under the umbrella of boosting internal talent, they have begun to stagnate in technological advancements. The best talent doesn't follow borders or boundaries. If anyone is skilled at the job and it's a high-demand one, all countries will still want to acquire them, regardless of whether they make it difficult or not.

By now, you probably know that this newsletter doesn't always provide specific steps to take; its primary purpose is to take a step back and offer you a timeless idea. Yet, I still ask the question of "What can I do in this era of deglobalization?

Understanding the whole system is almost impossible. Any prediction can be proven wrong in an instant. All we can do is to know what we aim for in life, follow a purpose, and ensure that what we chase is in high demand. If that makes us feel we don't belong where we are or that requires a change, we still have the opportunity to migrate to somewhere else.

Meanwhile, we must follow how policies evolve and their impact on our daily lives, work, and relationships is crucial. Therefore, we have to continue to read, analyze, and reposition ourselves again and again and again.

Let me know your observations on deglobalization. Just hit reply on this email.

## Good to Great

- While we're talking about demographic shift and migrations, what is our ethical obligation to refugees? Read a good essay: [Moral Refuge​](https://aeon.co/essays/a-philosophical-view-of-our-ethical-obligations-to-refugees)
- [​A better breathing exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) for instant relaxation. Read the video description before you begin. ([A related article from someone else](https://bakadesuyo.com/2025/01/how-to-be-healthier))
- "Alignment is the difference between progress and stagnation." Great post: [Alignment > Autonomy](https://buildrightside.com/autonomy-alignment).

## Recently, I Wrote About

I have a weekly Sunday ritual where I close out the week on my small agenda and write my weekly promises to myself for the upcoming week + some other habit tracking stuff. This ritual has been working so far for ~6 months. [I wrote a post about it](/a-weekly-planning-ritual-that-works/).

Until next time,
