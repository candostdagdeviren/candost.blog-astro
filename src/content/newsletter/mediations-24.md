I took a short break from writing due to some family matters, which have left me feeling incomplete. These days, I’m trying to come back and build those broken habits once again.

Although I didn't write much, I somehow had a lot of spare time for reading; 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there. It’s too short for writing but perfect for reading a few articles and books. Thanks to it, I caught up with the majority of the online articles I wanted to read, which were waiting on my endless reading list.

During reading, I realized one thing I had tried to avoid: focusing on reading a lot of things.

On my “About” page on my blog, there is a sentence I wrote: “I don’t care how many books I read.” This statement dilutes the importance of reading a lot and portrays reading well as a remedy.

Reading a lot and reading well are both crucial elements of life. Reading a lot is a discovery; reading well is a settlement. Without discovering, one never knows where to settle. Once settled, wanderlust kicks in after a while, and one seeks to discover. It’s a constant tension.

I’ve never stopped reading a lot of things. However, I slowed down discovery. These days, my wanderlust for reading new things is urging me to accumulate yet-another-reading-pile. This time, I’m not fighting back; I’m recovering my equilibrium.

Meanwhile, during this break, here are the three things I’ve read, from good to great.

## Good to Great

- _Good:_ Books are my main learning material. [Andy challenges the approach of existing non-fiction books to learning](https://andymatuschak.org/books/). Something to think about… (I love Andy’s writing by the way)
- _Better:_ I re-read [this](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/did-your-parents-have-friends). It’s on friendship, parents, and you. Read it and think about it.
- _Great:_ Somehow, I overlooked [this community](https://www.lesswrong.com). It’s the community and the content I’ve been scouring for years. I’m reading non-stop for days.

## Recently, I thought/wrote about

- I really, really, really can’t worry about the whole world. It’s not about becoming numb; it’s rather about staying sane. [I wrote about it](/i-cant-worry-about-the-whole-world/).
- The majority root cause of incidents in general is “people choosing the easy way,” as Lorin says. I [wrote a short one about it](/the-root-cause-of-all-incidents/).
- I mentioned this concept to my boss a few weeks back, and since then, we’ve been referring to it in our conversations. So, [I wrote a short one about it](/the-invisible-gun/).

_**P.S.** As I’m in discovery mode these days, add a comment and send me what you've found interesting lately._
