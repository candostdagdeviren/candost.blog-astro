I have now added Ko-fi support to my blog. I am still unsure about this, but I would like to experiment. I aimed to place it in the least intrusive place possible: at the end of the post.

I don't know how it will conflict with the two action buttons I have there.

I still prefer people commenting on the post instead of sending me money, but some people are more comfortable with the latter.

Let's see how this goes.

EDIT: I removed the link/button. It feels _weird_ to receive money from others for an open blog.
