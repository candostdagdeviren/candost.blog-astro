People are masters of complaint. Yet their feet keep walking the same path. They don’t surrender, retreat or abolish whatever they are not happy about. They are on a crusade with perennial whining.

I, too, do the same. I complain about my job and my responsibilities. I hate doing certain things again and again. I complain about many things I’ve committed to in life, and now it feels like I have no time to do them all.

But.

But I know and I tell out loud: I love it. I just love it.

I love that I’m failing to do them all. I love that I find it too stressful and difficult to resolve uncertainties or simplify complexities.

If I had a second chance, I would do it again without regret.

And you know what, everything becomes easier when you admit it.
