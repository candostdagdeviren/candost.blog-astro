I was watching [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJZRtbWoa60) from Easy German (as I'm learning German), and they did a street interview and asked a question to the people: "How will the world look like in 2050?" While watching the video, I started thinking about how the world would be in 2050. But unlike the Easy German team's goal, I didn't want to guess the world in 2050. So, I wanted to create a realistic wish list that I believe would move the world in a better direction.

I wish the world would:

- Have banned automobiles from using fuel everywhere.
- Have improved the power storage systems that can be used in commercial aviation.
- Have started supporting and funding environmentally friendly implementations in under-developed countries and started saving the planet.
- Have made many services digital-only, such as government and life administration services.
- Have figured out the dichotomy of social media and real-life relationships, and social media has evolved in a way that helps to harden real-life relationships instead of killing them.
- Have no more wars (but I know there will be, as there was no time in history without a war).
- Have closed the gender pay gap, and gender inequality is not an issue anymore.
- Have got to a point where everyone can live freely without any oppression from others, such as issues LGBTI+ people face and racism no longer exist.
- Have closed the strong division between poor and rich a little bit while the middle class has less crash in between.
- Have made cities more relaxed, chill, and liveable without traffic and stress, and urban planning evolved in a way that promotes healthy living without depending on cars and travel.
- Have recycled most of the materials.
- Have cleaned the oceans and rivers from trash.

I know most of these things will either not happen or will be in progress. Wishing is free, and if I'm wishing for these things, I also feel responsible for taking steps toward supporting these changes. I don't know what that support looks like, but I'm starting to think about it as the first step.
