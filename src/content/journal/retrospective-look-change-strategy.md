James Clear says,

> "You're more likely to unlock a big leap in performance by trying differently than by trying harder. You might be able to work 10% harder, but a different approach might work 10x better. Remain focused on the core problem, but explore a new line of attack. Persistence is not just about effort, but also strategy. Don't merely try harder, try differently."

I'm unsure about how much it holds true but it makes sense to retrospectively look at what you do and change your strategy.
