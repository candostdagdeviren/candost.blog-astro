There is also the other side of [this](/journal/employer-market-will-change/). Let's not put everything on C-level people; we can build some empathy.

In the recent event I joined (CTO Craft Con Berlin), Füsun Wehrmann mentioned how the CTO role evolved and how expectations and role definitions have changed.

What I learned from Füsun's talk was that the CTO role expanded from mostly operations to a business-driven approach.

CTOs are now expected to know how to run a business, including finance, product management and strategy, and people.

The most significant impact of this change requires CTOs to do more about transforming how the organization leads/manages budget and people, aligning the organization structure and roles to drive better product development, managing and up-skilling the talent, and hardening the hiring process.

We can say that this is eventually the craft of executive leadership. However, I want to emphasize that CTOs affect organizational decisions; they are also under pressure to expand their knowledge to understand the business as a whole, including finance, product, etc., going beyond operational management and technical leadership. This is not an easy thing.
