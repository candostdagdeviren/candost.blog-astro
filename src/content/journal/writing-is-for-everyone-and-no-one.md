Isn’t the writing about nothing but everything at the same time?

Words are written for everyone, but most are read by no one.

If nobody reads them, then why do we write?

I claim that I write for myself, but I rarely read them again.

Writing is for the clarity of the thought, but 99.99% of thoughts are still cluttered.

99% of the writing is not writing; it’s editing.

Then why don’t we call it editing? Because being an editor is also the role of a writer.

So, why do we have to edit?

Because without editing, the words either confuse or mean horrible things.

Decluttering thoughts is getting rid of the confusion and putting guardrails on thinking.

If we put guardrails, how do we insist that we are creative?

Without bounding conditions, creativity can’t find the end of the tunnel.

So, writing is about dealing with limitations, editing for clarity with the purpose of helping myself, but the output is for everyone else.
