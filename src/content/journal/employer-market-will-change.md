Currently, the tech market is an employer market, not an employee. Organizations are using this to their advantage. But don't forget this situation will change in time.

These days, during the interviews, employers can ask all candidates to fulfill two or three different roles, which they normally expect one person to do.

These days, it's okay to ask for a manager to do hands-on coding along with all their other responsibilities. Yet, employers are not careful enough what they are asking for. A hands-on manager rarely works (except for startups).

Employers can call everyone back to the office (hello, Amazon), expecting people to resign if they don't want to. Employers can play the cards, hiding behind "cultural investment," even if they know it hurts the diversity and inclusion efforts they spent so much money and effort on.

Employers have the upper hand because not everyone wants to change their jobs during these difficult times.

However, employers have to keep in mind one thing. Employer branding is like an insurance. You have to make your contribution first before you need it. When the market returns to an employee market{%sup%}1{% /sup%}, it will be too late for you to change and adjust your plans in the game.

So, if you're holding interviews or planning to hire, think about your long-term plans. Hiring really good employees is still a big problem for everyone. If you're looking for a person who can do three roles simultaneously, maybe you should re-evaluate your strategy.

Whoever is interviewing for a job these days, good luck!! Don't forget that if you fail an interview, the problem is not fully on you, especially now.
