Charity wrote [a post](https://charity.wtf/2025/04/19/on-writing-social-media-and-finding-the-line-of-embarrassment/). It’s probably one of the things I miss the most on Twitter as well. Having the tech industry yapping about things, being a close community where you get to know a lot of opinions, and sharing what’s on your plate without the hassle of writing a blog post.

That’s why I added a journal section to my blog to replicate what I’ve done on Twitter back then. Yet, I fail to write at a frequency similar to Twitter, just as Charity said.

So, Charity promises an article per week; I’ll join as well. One entry per week in either the post or journal section, mostly 750-850 words (excluding certain weeks of the year when I travel).

Like Charity, this is my public accountability post and commitment.
