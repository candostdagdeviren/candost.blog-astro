I've been thinking about something similar for a while. Here are my added thoughts (read Ava’s post first for the complete picture).

The personalities we build always have masks, either in real life or online. AI didn’t change it; it made it easier. I think the trust was always problematic when it comes to authenticity.

Maybe someone like Ava tries to be as authentic as possible on the internet (especially on the personal blog). But it was never the case for everyone. I truly try to show my real thinking on my personal blog. Yet I’m 100% sure I talk differently with my wife or my parents.

That said, I agree we lost trust in the web because of AI fabrication. The trust in the content was already kind of broken; now it’s shattering.

Still, I want to look at the world more optimistically. The Internet remains a main enabler for diversity.

I met so many different people online before and after AI. I’ve never seen 99% of these people in real life. Whether our conversations with these cool people are real or fabricated. For me, the experience with the person that counts—the feeling.

I still meet people online; that doesn’t change. AI doesn’t send me an email to respond to my blog post; a human does. I don’t have a conversation with AI over email. Although these people might be producing content with AI but our conversations feel real. And that’s what matters.

I also acknowledge that offline beats online when it comes to feelings. I’m happy to see that offline finally gets back on track. Now, we can get the power of both.
