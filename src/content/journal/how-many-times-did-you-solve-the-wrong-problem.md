How many times did you see someone solving the wrong problem?

How many times did you catch yourself doing the same?

I often catch myself focusing on the wrong problem or a non-urgent one because it's easy to focus on what we like or what we think will position us well.

I heard from one of my previous leaders that solving a problem that nobody even wants to get close to brought them a lot of learning. So, maybe we shouldn’t invent problems that don’t need any solution or whose solutions don’t matter.

Instead, we should seek the most critical problem. Even looking for that will teach us many things along the way.
