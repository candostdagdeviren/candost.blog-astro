In February, I gave a talk at the DecompileD Conference in Dresden, Germany, titled “Building Incident Management Skills.” I shared how we built and implemented the Incident Coordinator Role, which is focused on reducing the pressure from first responder engineers and coordinating the incident, allowing engineers to focus on resolving the incident quickly.

This month, I will be speaking at L8Conf in Warsaw, Poland. This time, I’ll talk about “Overcoming Bottlenecks of Platform Teams.” How a platform team should approach their workload and which thinking strategies they should use will be the topic of the day. Preparing for this talk takes much more time than I initially thought. I will be exposing my failures in the last two years. I’m excited and nervous at the same time.
