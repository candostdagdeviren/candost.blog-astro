Nature heals all the pains, sufferings, struggles, and challenges. Watching the sunset makes you forget the daily concerns; watching sunrise can give you another perspective.

Sitting idle on the beach adds no value to your life in terms of modern expectations; however, it’s one of the most valuable and precious moments you can experience. The sound of the waves, people chatting in a distance on the beach, and music coming from far away that you can’t even distinguish its genre; they all make you feel something—a feeling that is hard to name. Maybe, you don’t need to name it even; you only feel. You only experience.

Especially when you don’t worry about recording the moment on your phone, the moment you see with your eyes instead of seeing it through your phone’s lens, that moment itself becomes scratched to your brain, to your heart, and to your soul. That moment you never forget and can live anywhere again and again.
