    <h1 class="fa-stack-1x fa-2x mb-5 mt-10">Notes</h1>
    <p class="mt-5">These are my short notes keep to myself. Yet, I want to make them publicly available.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">These notes are in my Slip-Box in my Zettelkasten. We can call them as Digital Garden as well but I prefer calling the whole system Zettelkasten.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">The number in front of the note indicates a Zettel number in my Slip-Box. I use them to link a note to other notes. The numbering system I adapted is directly from the Zettelkasten.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">If you dive into notes, you'll see many notes that are not visible below. Also not all notes are connected to each other and not all notes have sources linked to it. Many notes have pointers to exact references in my non-public Zettelkasten but I didn't want to open up those exact references because there is no value for anyone. Here, I only shared the name of the resource instead of the exact reference (e.g., page number in a book).</p>
    <p class="mt-3">All notes has creation dates and update dates. Many notes has the same creation dates because I moved my notes between different softwares and lost the creation dates during migration.</p>

    <p class="mt-10">You can get all notes via <a href="/notes/rss.xml">a dedicated RSS feed</a> to your favorite RSS reader.</p>

    <p class="fa-m mb-10 mt-10">The notes are ordered by their numbers, not chronologically.</p>
