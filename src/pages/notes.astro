    <p class="mt-5">These are my short notes keep to myself. Yet, I want to make them publicly available.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">These notes are in my Slip-Box in my Zettelkasten.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">The number in front of the note indicates a Zettel number in my Slip-Box. I use them to link a note to other notes. The numbering system I adapted is directly from the Zettelkasten.</p>
    <p class="mt-3">If you dive into notes, you'll see all notes are connected to each other but not all notes have sources linked to it. Many notes have references in my non-public Zettelkasten; I didn't want to open up those exact references because there is no value for anyone as they are not well-organized or well-written. Here, I only share the name of the resource instead of the exact reference (e.g., page number in a book).</p>
    <p class="mt-3">All notes have published and update dates. Published dates represent the time I added the note to my Zettelkasten. Yet, many notes has the exact same creation date because I moved my notes between different softwares (from Notion to Obsidian) and lost the creation dates during migration. ðŸ¤·</p>
