# Who is Candost?

I used to think that reading would make me wise.

One day, ten pages before finishing a book, I realized that I had read that same book before. At that point, my perspective on reading and, therefore, my life had changed.

Now, I don't care how many books I read; I take many notes, connect dots, and share what I've found on this blog and [my newsletter](/newsletter/).

I'm interested in many things at the same time. On this blog, you’ll find me talking to about multiple aspects of life like leadership, software engineering, philosophy, psychology, software architecture & design, urban & industrial design, exercising, finance, F1, eating healthy, and many more

I’m a software engineering manager; that’s my current job. At home, I'm a writer and an avid reader.

I rarely watch TV, movies or TV series.

I don't have any analytics on this blog because how many people reading my writing is not what I care about. I care about how many replies or comments to my thoughts so we can have meaningful conversations.
