# Who is Candost?

I used to think that reading would make me wise.

One day, ten pages before finishing a book, I realized that I had read that same book before. At that point, my perspective on reading and, therefore, my life had changed.

Now, I don't care how many books I read; I take [many notes](/notes/), connect dots, and share what I've found on this blog and [my newsletter](/newsletter/).

I'm interested in many things at the same time (I'm a [multipotentialite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality)). On this blog, you’ll find me talking to about multiple aspects of life like leadership, software engineering, philosophy, psychology, software architecture & design, urban & industrial design, exercising, finance, Formula1 Racing, eating healthy, and many more.

I’m a software engineering manager; that’s my current job.

At home, I'm a writer and an avid reader.

I rarely watch TV, movies or TV series. [I don't have any social media](/my-experience-living-without-social-media/) account (except Mastodon where I have automated posting of my new articles). Hence, I often miss the popular culture references in conversations. That's alright. I don't have FOMO; [I embrace JOMO](/embracing-the-joy-of-missing-out/).

I rarely read fictional books.

I run, train for strength and do fitboxing. I am focused on increasing my lifespan and improving my healthspan.

[I don't have any analytics on this blog](/there-are-no-analytics-on-this-blog/) because knowing how many people reading my writing is NOT what I care about. I care about replies or comments to my thoughts so we can have meaningful conversations.
