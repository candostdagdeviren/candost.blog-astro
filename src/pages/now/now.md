# What I'm Doing Now?

_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about?ref=candost.blog), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about?ref=candost.blog), too.)_

- I'm learning how to make better investments in general.
- I am focused on getting back to writing regularly. I publish a new newsletter issue at least every two weeks.
- These days, I'm still trying to stick to my habits that I planned at the beginning of the year. It's been 3 months now and still going good.
- I gave two talks in two conferences ([DecompileD](https://decompiled.de) & [L8Conf](https://l8conf.com)) this year and joined an engineering leadership panel once. I'll give [a short talk and do a small workshop in Berlin in two days](https://lu.ma/nl0x95he). I aim to give two more talks this year.

## Reading

- I'm reading Quiet by Susan Cain to better understand myself and people around me.
- I'm reading The Road to Character by David Brooks.
- I'm listening to Principles by Ray Dalio when I'm walking my dog.

## Work

I am still working as [an Engineering Manager at SumUp](/joining-sumup).

There is not so much I can write about work here but we've been doing pretty amazing work lately. When I'm at work, I'm focused there. When I'm outside, I don't want to think about it.

## Family and Friends Time

I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and loving—a fantastic human being.

I also spend time with my friends, better called my selected family, as they are fantastic people.
