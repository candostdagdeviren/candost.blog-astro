# What I'm Doing Now?

_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about?ref=candost.blog), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about?ref=candost.blog), too.)_

- I'm learning about how to understand a company's financial statements like Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow. I am very interested in understanding how the world works and I think understanding how organizations work will help me take a step forward.
  - To do that, I started taking an online Financial & Accounting course and I'm matching it with MIT's 14.02 Principles of Macroeconomics course. Taking them together help me understand both macro and micro together.
- As of writing this, I'm on vacation but in Berlin. Without the hassle of travelling and organizing anything, I spend time on things that I don't usually find time when I'm working full-time. I take long walks with my dog, do some life administration tasks, etc. I highly recommend taking a week off and going nowhere.

I'm considering a lot of things (as I have a lot of time to think about anything) including, but not limited to, what kind of work I want to do, working remotely vs. working from the office, managing my energy, time, and stress levels better, and my career path.

## Reading

- I am still reading Plato's Republic for the first time. I had a feeling that it will take a lot of time to read. I passed the second half.
- I also started reading Seneca's De Vita Beata. It's very interesting and short book. It's the first time I'm reading Seneca and I will read this book right after finishing it.
- I also match the finance & accounting course I'm taking online with the book Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements. It goes remarably well. Also, when I'm walking my dog, I listen to Poor Charlie's Almanack. These days, I'm a big fan of Berkshire Hattaway but the next will be learning other types of investing (Graham's value investing first).
- While on vacation, I re-read Deep Work by Cal Newport. I needed that refresh after reading Four Thousand Weeks that's been gifted by a friend.

## Work

I am still working as [an Engineering Manager at SumUp](/joining-sumup).

There is not so much I can write about work here but one thing I'm thinking about these days is reducing tech debt and creating the future vision of my team. If you have any strategy that worked for you, send me an email at candost at candostdagdeviren dot com.

## Family and Friends Time

I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and loving—a fantastic human being.

I also spend time with my friends, better called my selected family, as they are fantastic people. I have a few new friends I got in Berlin, and spending time with new people is exciting.
