I've been sick for a while with seasonal flu. While slowly recovering still, I started a no-carbs diet that I will try for a few weeks to shed a bit of weight before I start a new exercise plan.

I signed up for the Berlin Triathlon along with the Berlin Half Marathon in 2026. I like having these events as goals for myself and use them to have a structured training plan. I've run a half marathon before, but never tried a triathlon; a new experience awaits me.

Meanwhile, in the last two months, I completed a Level 1 Improv class that I signed up for spontaneously. It was ultra fun. Learning how to embrace the chaotic ambiguity and let the chaos emerge on stage feels very different (in a good way). We had a class show, and I also enjoyed the part where I made myself look like a fool on the stage for others' entertainment (on purpose).

Somehow, I'm also getting back to writing more often. I don't know whether it's related to being sick and staying at home or having clarity in my mind, I write more (not my journal, but for this blog) after a few months of hiatus. This time, I do my research with Perplexity and use Claude to structure article and get feedback; it's working great. I still do the writing myself, but use both AI tools as a private researcher and a copy & developmental editor. Totally recommended.

## Reading

I've also increased my reading. Instead of grabbing my phone every 3-5 minutes, I grab the book I carry everywhere.

- I'm listening to Thinking, Fast & Slow by Daniel Kahneman for the second time.
- I'm reading Chip War by Chris Miller.
- I'm extracting my notes from two books: Critical Thinking by Jonathan Haber & The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John C. Bogle.

## Work

I am still working as [an Engineering Manager at SumUp](/joining-sumup).

On the side, I'll start being a part-time trainer for [the AI Software Engineering Bootcamp by Digitale Leute](https://school.digitale-leute.de/bootcamps/ai-software-engineering).

I will also host two activities in LeadDev Berlin on November 3-4, 2025.

## Family and Friends Time

I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and loving—a fantastic human being.

I also spend time with my friends, better called my selected family, as they are fantastic people.
