Mediations Newsletter is becoming a curated newsletter where I share what I've been thinking about recently and a few things passing from my screens, life, and eyes.

The style will be between [James Clear's 3-2-1](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1), [Cassidoo's rendezvous](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive), and [FS.Blog's Brain Food](https://fs.blog/brain-food/). I don't know what exactly the content will be because I want to reflect the complexity of life. Therefore, I won't try even to niche down into one area here. I don't want to be a content creator in a certain niche.

For example, I often advise others, and people find them useful. The funny thing is I don't always follow my own advice. Because giving useful advice is much easier than applying that advice to your life, we can see things better for others while we don't look at ourselves the same way. Here, I want to share those bits of advice that I shared with some people in my life.

Also, many people don't read long articles from their email inboxes. Receiving articles in your inbox doesn't feel personal. I want to form relationships over these emails. The best way to do that is to show you what's passing in my life.

Feel free to just reply to the email you get at any time. Also, all issues will be available on [my blog](https://candost.blog) too. I will send emails via Substack because it's free and public and is an alternative to reading on its app. If you want to follow the blog or newsletter, there are separate RSS feeds for each.

Meanwhile, I'll keep emailing some articles, but you can unsubscribe from them anytime you want here.

The Mediations Newsletter has no cadence, but I will send it a maximum of once a week, not more.

Anyway, let's get to the first issue.

## Some things I found great

These links won't be the hottest or newest links but rather what I recently spent time on and/or recommended to someone.

- [How Can You Get Closer to the People You Care About?](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-can-you-get-closer-to-the-people-you-care-about/) — A few months ago, I had a conversation with one of my best friends about how much we know each other and how much we actually don't because we never speak about deep personal values. I listened to this episode because it reminded me of that discussion. I don't know how many of you have tried to make your relationships better, but I want to get better at this. I already learned a few things I want to try, such as using phrases like, "What I hear you say is... And that makes me feel..."
- [Just normal web things.](https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2023/07/just-normal-web-things/) — Heather Buchel wrote a great piece about how websites manipulate our experience and how much we want to keep things in a certain way. The most frustrating one for me is her last point—when a website hijacks my browser shortcuts. I hate it.
- [Julia's Latest Video covering Dua Lipa's Dance The Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wKJZVgftSk) — Julia, again, made an awesome bass cover.
- [Lee Ritenour & Dave Grusin Live at Java Jazz Festival 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUt_pnutRtI) — While YouTube was playing one video after another in the background while I was writing something, this video came up. I had never heard of these people before, but I enjoyed every second. What a wonderful concert.
- [The Most Important Management Concept You're Missing: Task Relevant Maturity](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/management-concept/) — I'm trying to improve my staff planning skills, and this post helped me to think about when I plan who should do what in our team(s).
- [Honest, Candid, and Frank](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/honest-candid-and-frank/) — Should I give honest or candid feedback or be frank? Now I learned the difference. From now on, I'll give candid feedback, always be honest and talk frankly often.
- [Team Topologies](/books/team-topologies-book-review-summary-and-notes/) — I keep coming back to this book lately because I'm thinking about how we can structure teams to better collaborate with other teams in certain ways.

## Recently, I thought about

*seeking inconvenience*.

How much time and money do we spend in our lives while we are making everything convenient? I optimized my life so much that I had much time to do many things. Yet, I lost the joy in them.

Does everything have to be convenient? That's the question of the week. Inconvenience brings out the beauty of something. For example, writing must be on paper with a pen at hand. I spend so much time on the computer and keep all my notes on it that I stopped writing by hand. Writing is not about efficiency; it's about evaluating ideas, reshaping them, and slowing down the thought stream so that we can catch the good fish in a dirty river.

Choosing which movie to watch should be by referrals and recommendations from people we know and trust, not by what algorithms recommend us. We have to go to the movie theater, watch a movie our friend recommended and hate that movie. We have to feel the waste of time in that movie. We shouldn't watch great movies all the time.

We must do activities and be fully there while doing them. Who drinks coffee and does nothing else? How many people have you seen sitting on a couch and listening to music without a phone or book at hand? Or when was the last time you did that?

That's what I'm leaving you with this week. Look at your life; find where you don't need comfort and convenience. Seek inconvenience in activities that you like to do. If you like drinking coffee, try only drinking coffee without a side activity. If you like listening to music, try sitting on a couch and listening to the music your eyes closed. You'll recognize the difference. And send me an email about how the experience was.
