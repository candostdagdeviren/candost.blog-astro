Hey friend,

I hope you and everyone you care about are well.

I was thinking for a while about writing about the time I conflicted with someone in my team, how we solved it, and the lessons I took from it. But I couldn't find a chance to write it down until now.

A few years ago, when I wanted to become a leader, I got pushback. I asked how can I improve myself and where do I lack the knowledge and skills. One of the first topics was conflict management because I had conflicts that I needed to solve first.

I was not seeing why I had a conflict with another person. Although conflicts are natural and happen all the time, comprehending why it happens is complicated. I asked my managers to coach me. That coaching changed my perspective dramatically. Here, I will share what I learned during that time.

Most often, in conflicts, we focus on the other person. We think that they are the ones who have problems. They can't understand what we're trying to achieve. We wish they could have changed their perspective. But you know what, the other person thinks _exactly_ the same for us.

Statements starting with the word "you" all the time: "you don't understand," "you did this when I told you to do this," etc. We usually forget that conflicts in relationships require a minimum of two people.

To change our perspective and [move from "I" to "we,"](/newsletter/mektup-9/) we first need to _identify and name_ the situation. Naming the conflict is the first step toward acceptance.

When we acknowledge a conflict, we lower our guard and take a step back. Confessing empowers seeing the three entities every relationship has: us, the other person, and our relationship. Naming moves our focus from the person to the relationship. Starting our sentences with "we" broaden our view.

After saying, "We have a conflict," out loud, one of my managers asked me a question that shook me. I still remember the feeling. My indirect manager and I were in a small meeting cabin in the office, and we were talking about the conflict; she asked me, "How do you contribute to the problem you have?"

I couldn't answer immediately because your contribution to the conflict is unclear until someone points it out. For example, when I asked myself that question again many times, I realized that my role in the team was not clear.

My direct manager and I were working together to grow me to a team leader position, and I was taking extra responsibilities as a training. But this was not well-communicated to the team. Additionally, we had a project we had to finish, and it was delayed because of a lack of resources. I wanted to have fewer discussions and just work. I was rushing the project while our team members were relatively new and needed conversations for onboarding. So, my contribution to the problem had two aspects. First, not being clear about my growth path, and second, I rushed the project to release.

Together with my manager, we put everything together and had one big session with the whole team where we discussed the project, the remaining work, and our approach to finishing it. I also explained my intention to become a leader. I realized my contribution to the conflict and changed my perspective by answering that question. I still cannot believe that it only took two hours to solve weeks of battle. Lessons learned.

So, here is my recommendation to you.

If you have difficult conversations with a person, _**first name the situation**_. What is that you're dealing with? It will help you to evaluate the conditions. When you name it, you extract yourself from the problem and observe the whole picture.

Next, _**ask yourself how you contribute to the problem**_. Remember that any relationship has three attributes (you, another person, and the relationship). Which one are you focusing on? Move your focus to the relationship and analyze how you contribute to it.

**Making relationships great demands two people, and making them dreadful and desperate needs only one person.**

When you explicitly realize your contribution, you tend to change your approach and be more forgiving.

What do you think? Have you been conflicted before that you even didn't realize that you were conflicted? How do you think this applies to you?

I am looking forward to seeing your response! Hit reply to the mail; all messages arrive in my primary inbox.

Until next time, take care.
