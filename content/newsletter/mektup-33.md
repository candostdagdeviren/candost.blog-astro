Hey friend,

In [the last Mektup](/newsletter/mektup-32), I talked about product thinking. That **[struck a chord on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31595285)**, and thousands of people read and commented on it. I haven’t read the comments yet. I always have mixed feelings about comments (stress/curiosity/doubt) on HN; that’s why I’m waiting a bit.

With that, **this month my blog has passed a big milestone of 100,000 page views from whopping 94,000 visitors like you!** I started this blog in December 2020. Although I was mainly writing on my previous blogs, starting fresh and building up was a big challenge; it still is. However, I enjoy writing down my thoughts and learnings and will keep doing it for the foreseeable future.

Anyway, in honor of achieving the milestone, I will keep it short and recommend five articles I have written before. These articles will help you gain a new perspective, open doors in your growth path, and challenge you. Although I wrote them a while back, they are timeless and still popular.

Give them a read if you haven't yet!

## Effective 1:1 Meetings for Engineers

**​[Article](/effective-1-on-1-meetings-own-your-one-on-one-meeting/)​**

There are many 1:1 guides for managers but near to nothing for engineers. The meeting is for engineers; it’s their meeting. Therefore, engineers should own the meeting and make it effective. If your manager doesn’t care about 1:1s, you can nudge them. This is what I did. When I changed my perspective and worked on improving my 1:1 meetings, the results were terrific. I increased my communication with my manager, and I felt I was learning and growing faster than usual. This led me to become an engineering manager.

## How to Stop Endless Discussions

**​[Article](/how-to-stop-endless-discussions/)​**

When we find ourselves in endless debates where everyone defends their idea (tabs vs. spaces, React vs. Angular, iOS vs. Android, Reactive vs. Object-Oriented programming), we don't know how to handle the situation. We often create conflicts between ourselves and other team members. We eventually find a way out, but what we need is an excellent system. In this article, I explain that system.

## Bias for Action

**​[Article](/bias-towards-action/)​**

I always thought that we needed to learn all of the fundamentals of a topic before taking any action. It was the approach I took as a software engineer. I spent my whole life going down rabbit holes, researching, learning, and coming up with solutions that substantially solved the problem. Think twice (or more); code once. I was wrong with my approach. All I needed was action. Having a bias to action is more helpful than discussing and researching everything prior. Quantity beats quality in learning. Action beats perfection.

## Don’t Assume Consensus in The Absence of an Objection

**​[Article](/dont-assume-consensus-in-the-absence-of-objection/)​**

Consensus decision-making means everyone explicitly agreeing to the proposed idea. The leader needs explicit agreement from everyone and shouldn't assume consensus in the absence of objection. Many people assume there is a consensus when they don't and are faced with silence. This pattern became more common in virtual meetings. In this post, I shared why we have these silences and how it impacts the decision.

## The Decision-Making Pendulum
**​[Article](/the-decision-making-pendulum/)​**

The most critical problem I've seen is having struggles in the decision-making process. The inflexibility in decision-making is at the root of various issues. Many leaders either use a lot of authority or seek consensus. I wrote this post about The Decision-Making Pendulum. The leaders must learn the skills to move in the pendulum from side to side.

Until next time, take care!
