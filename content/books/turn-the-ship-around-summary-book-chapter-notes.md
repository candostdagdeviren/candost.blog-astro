## üåü My Review

David explains his success in one of the most top-down structures in the world, in the navy. The results from leader-leader structure is impressive. Emancipating competent people within clear goals is powerful. Once people take the ownership of what they do, they do it better. They not only stop the bad competition between themselves, but also focus on improving the existing mechanisms that's set in stone beforehand.

Leader-follower structure is a passive structure. Since everything is on the leader's side, followers' start making many mistakes when they wait for an order. Turning everyone into leader prevents many mistakes even before happening.

Success of David Marquet is one lesson for all leaders. However, I can't stop asking myself "How someone can help to setup elements of leader-leader structure in an organization when they are not a leader?"

I gave 8 out of 10. Because of the structure of some parts in writing. Even though I was excited and hooked to the story, David Marquet connected stories with direct teaching style such as "do this," or "do that". I understand the intend here. However, it's not my style. Also, there are great questions at the end of each section. Sometimes these questions are overwhelming. Although I loved the questions and would love to answer them, there are 100+ questions overall the book. Once we have that many question, I hardly think that people (including me) will take time to answer them.

## üìí Summary + Notes

> How has failure shaped you?
>

The great question where we need to think about it a lot before saying a word.

Reflection on oneself is a great deal. Learning what kind of leadership relationship you would like to create is a process. It takes time and experience. Once you see a great leadership-leadership structure, you cannot stop thinking about how much it empowers.

On the other side, leadership-follower structure is in the bones of the army. Also, a lot of leaders are using the same strategy in the current businesses.

Leadership-follower structure is problematic because every responsibility lies in the leaders. Followers only "follow orders" that leadership gives. Followers don't feel empowered. After being in the system for a while, they don't even think before doing something. Most of the times, they do what they have been told. Keeping this strategy may work for some organizations. However, it requires very strong leadership and a lot of effort in the command-chain.

Correctness and punctuality is highly important in the army. The lives depend on these two terms. The leader-follower structure creates blockers. When one order is given, no one can question it. Therefore, the feeling of empowered loosen and get lost.

Also, when the leaders make every decision, it creates a bottleneck and blocks things that are trivial for the business. These trivial tasks might be important for followers. Since the leader doesn't mind them, the followers lose motivation because of the unheard feeling.

When a leader in the command of chain wants to implement a leader-leader structure in the leader-follower organization, it ends up with a disaster. Immature changes are problematic and ends up with worse scenarios than before. While people are still feeling as a follower, they cannot act like leaders and mistakes happen.
