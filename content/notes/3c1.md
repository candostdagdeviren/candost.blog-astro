To be able to give someone autonomy and ownership, the person has to have the necessary technical capability. If they lack the skills, they will make wrong calls/judgments.

Seeing training as increasing decision-making authority is a good way. It makes people first better at their job, and second, they start owning the decisions with more trust in themselves. Their fear dissolves in time. Increased competency means increased decision-making authority.
