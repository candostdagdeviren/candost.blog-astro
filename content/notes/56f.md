When organizations are poorly managed, usually, there is chaos between teams: either more interaction than necessary or no interaction at all where it needs to be. Clearly defining the expected interaction mode will provide clarity, and engineers will understand what is expected from the other team. In return, the organization will benefit by reducing cognitive load and unnecessary conversations in places where there is no need and increasing innovation by using close collaboration between teams where it needs to be.
