Every idea in each creative process has inconsistencies and missing parts. They reveal themselves in the execution step. When an author has an idea, they don't realize the inconsistencies in the idea and don't see the missing points until writing it down. A software engineer cannot oversee every missing part of the design or inconsistent structure until the implementation part or experimentation starts. That's why ideas will always be raw and not great until they see an execution.
