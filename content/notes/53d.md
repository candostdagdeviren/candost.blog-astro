When we listen, we give the best gift: our attention. If we take time and listen to someone, why shouldn't we do it well? We have already given our time. We could also share our attention too. When people don't give their attention while listening to someone, the other side feels it. Listening well is not looking like you're listening but also consists of asking questions with curiosity and responding to the other side. Empathetic listeners make others relaxed and put down their defensive walls. People feel less stress when talking to these listeners. That's why when these listeners ask questions, the talkers encourage themselves to explore their thoughts more deeply and share what they have found.
