Asking questions has two sides: questioning and curiosity. Which one are you doing? When we ask questions to people, we either question them or ask them to learn. Once we go with curiosity, the truth rises in answers. People don't think that we are judgmental, and they give the best answer they can. However, when we approach to question them in any way, they start being defensive and try only to fulfill the need. If we're a manager and we ask questions to learn something (out of curiosity), our reports will give the best answer they can.
