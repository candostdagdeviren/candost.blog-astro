Trust is built by respect and transparency. Employees feel respected when the leader gives them what they need; equipment, devices, coffee machines, and _information_. People should feel empowered when their needs are fulfilled.

When the leader hides information, people can't do their jobs because they need the information to make decisions and execute tasks. If the leader wants people to bring solutions, own projects, and become loyal employees, the leader should give the information. Secrecy only leads to low morale and people feeling like pawns, not players (an Engineering Manager at previous job).

When there is no transparency, people will hear different things—often the wrong ones—and it will impact many decisions and morale. As the secrecy goes on, it will also be difficult to detect and notice these problems.
