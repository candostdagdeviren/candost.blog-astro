As a leader, you're responsible for people and their promotions. If you are making the call for promotion for your team member, then it's easier. If you're not the one who decides on the promotion, you need to learn how to play the promotion game. Every company has different game rules. But regardless of the company, junior people often get promoted at least once in their first two years. As usual, you make the call for promotion with HR; if you don't stop these junior folks, it will be enough with some coaching.

For more senior roles, it's tricky. Find the stretch projects where they need to go beyond their skills and stretch to learn. Give these projects to the people close to the promotion. Together with them, you need to build their case. If you can't find opportunities in your team, then look for other teams and even other companies to help your report grow, even if it means you will lose them.
