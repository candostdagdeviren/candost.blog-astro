If you want to climb Mount Everest, you don't start by going there and walking up. You first start in small mountains and build up your skills gradually. After you master the necessary skills and build up your body for the challenge, you plan to climb Everest. Even when you start climbing to the highest mountain in the world, you spend nights in camps to get used to the climate and have a rest. You don't always go up every single day. This is the same thing as being an engineer. Start building basics and master. Choose higher mountains every time. Have rest in between to allow your body and brain to have a rest.
