Writing by hand is more effective than writing on a computer or other electronic device. Handwriting forces us to understand the fundamental idea, concept, and structure of the thought better. The main reason is that handwriting is slow. We cannot be faster to write everything we hear. We have to be selective and write what we understand in the clear and the shortest way possible.
