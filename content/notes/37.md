> "While goals give direction, systems make progress."

Focusing on systems bring result and help us to reach goals. Goals only set the course. If we leave the port and set our course only half a degree wrong, we end up in a totally different place.

Use goals to set a direction and systems to find clues that distract you from the goal. Keep your main focus on having good systems that tell you you're off.
