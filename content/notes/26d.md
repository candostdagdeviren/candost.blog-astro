Deploy smaller batches until the transaction cost (cost of deployment, cost of people and time, infrastructure cost, etc.) makes smaller batches inefficient.

Big batches have other costs, such as the number of people needed to align increases with code freezes, communication, and testing. And also, the possibility of having a change that is difficult to revert (data migrations) is costly. The mean time to recover increases a lot.
