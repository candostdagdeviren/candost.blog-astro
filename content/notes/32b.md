If a leader makes an organizational change, they have to write down clearly what it is about. No leader has all the answers. So, they must show people they don't have all the answers. They have to be authentic, intentional, and emotional. While announcing an organizational change, they should add TL;DR (executive summaries are not only for executives) and FAQ to the document. What leaders have is the context, and they have to give people the context; why they had to make this decision and what the things others can't see (things that are only visible to leaders).
