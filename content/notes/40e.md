While receiving [a code review](/notes/21/), we need to express ourselves and coach the other person. There is a reason for any decision we make. Sometimes, people don't see these reasons. Instead of insisting on being right, we need to tell the people what's been left out in the feedback/review we receive. If the decisions are not explicit (such as with [ADRs](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)), it's not easy to see implicit decisions even if the code is well written.
