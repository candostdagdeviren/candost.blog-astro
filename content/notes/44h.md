Irrationally repeating the same arguments, staying the same line repeatedly, and not budging frustrates people, and they raise shields. If we don't present humility and never accept valid arguments, we become irrational. We can ask, "What evidence would change your mind?" in any heated discussion to break this habit. [Asking questions with curiosity](/notes/4a/) shows them that we're open to changing our minds instead of being stubborn over our arguments. When we show humility and weaknesses in our arguments, the other side joins the [debate dance](/books/think-again-by-adam-grant-book-summary-review-and-notes/), and we begin forming trust with the other side.
