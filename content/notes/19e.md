How can we validate objections to make faster decisions that are "safe to try?"

Give everyone a chance to object to the decision by asking
> "Does anyone have evidence why trying this proposal would cause immediate harm? If so, please suggest an edit that would make it safe to try."

Whenever you hear an objection, ask three questions in order.

1. Are you objecting because you have a better idea? Yes → Invalid objection.
2. Is the problem you foresee a future problem or now problem? Future → Invalid objection
3. Will that "now problem" be easy to recover from? Yes → Invalid objection.
