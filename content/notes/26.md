Whenever we delay deploying minor fixes of software (changes in small batches), the repair cost also escalates. The minor work becomes major and requires more work every moment we delay. The increase in effort and expense is non-linear.

When the batch size becomes larger, people start multitasking in deployments because they have many different things to take a look at. Deployment often takes a long time and requires big parallel tasks like running migrations, checking if the data aggregation is correct, etc. They lose focus on individual tasks. Stress becomes high.
