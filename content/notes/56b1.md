In theory, having team APIs is great and can work in relaxed times. Defining and enforcing them is tricky in a dynamic company that changes every few months. Team APIs need a constant team with a consistent push to follow the APIs. In practice, it is difficult. Another part is who will be responsible for keeping them up-to-date. Writing down all these documents should be everyone's work in the team. Only a dedicated person should be accountable. If the team is mature enough, they can keep updating their APIs. If the team is not mature enough, the manager has to follow up on APIs to ensure they are updated regularly. That's extra work for the team. Yet, it's highly possible to achieve.
