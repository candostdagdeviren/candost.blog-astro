Everyone has their own rules in their heads. We interpret and evaluate situations and other people's behavior with our rules. The events, situations, and, therefore, the available data are the same for everyone. When there is an announcement at work about the team or organizational changes. People interpret the news differently and react to these changes differently. Many misunderstandings and conflicts occur because we see the rules as not *our* rules but *the* rules. Calling it a lack of empathy would be a simple and wrong inference. That's why we first need to understand the available data, and later, we can learn our own rules and the rules of other people. Only then can we interpret in our way while knowing and understanding the data and common ground truly. This approach gives us different opportunities to give feedback and understand the feedback we receive.
