A daily highlight is a method to focus on your day. The flexible highlight that is achievable within 60-90 minutes of focused time keeps your attention on one thing. If you achieve your highlight during the day, you're done with the day.

Having a highlight, help you to adjust other tasks to open a space for the highlight. If your calendar is full of meetings, you will look for ways to create a space to work on your highlight.

If you realize you can't achieve your highlight of the day, you can still change it in the middle of the day. You can also use the same highlight on multiple days if you haven't finished yet. Flexibility is the power of the highlight. But keep your highlights within the 60-90 minutes achievable range.
