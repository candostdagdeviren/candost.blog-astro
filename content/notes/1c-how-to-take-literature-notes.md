Write briefly what you understood and your thoughts in your own sentences.

Keep all notes in one place.

Sort them alphabetically with surname_year format.

Match them with bibliographic details in your system.

The goal is understanding the text and preparing to transfer ideas into the context of our own thought lines in the slip-box.
