When we want to appreciate someone's work or behavior, we often use generic forms such as "good work" or "thanks for everything you've done." But we give ninety-nine details and a big explanation when it comes to the negative feedback that focuses on improvements. The appreciation has to be as specific as the negative ones.

Only being specific is not enough; the delivery method is important, and it depends on the person who receives the feedback. Some people need an email to the whole team or public praise in a meeting; some only need their paycheque paid on time. Clarify how and in which format the feedback receiver wants to hear before praising them.

Last but not least, the feedback has to be authentic. Be mindful and selective. If you always give appreciation for every small thing, they begin to be worth less in time. You create appreciation inflation. Be authentic and specific on *when* you are going to give appreciation in *which* form. The format and timing combination can vary; use whatever suits the person and the situation best.
