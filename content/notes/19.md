Justifying the decisions is a complicated process. When we make any decision, there has to be a case we should justify. [Charity put it](https://charity.wtf/2022/09/23/the-hierarchy-is-bullshit-and-bad-for-business/) greatly that if our internal decisions leak, we should be able to justify it well. If we can't, or we're ashamed of our decision, then the decision is wrong. Hence, asking ourselves a few simple questions while making decisions is a solid strategy to prevent unwanted results. We can simply ask ourselves, “Would I be able to justify the decision if it's leaked? Would I be ashamed of it? Am I comfortable with people knowing this decision?” Then we know which decision is wrong.
