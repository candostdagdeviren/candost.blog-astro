Similar to the business need we talked about above, the business decision has to be made before writing an RFC. RFC focuses on *how*, not *what*—deciding on *what* has to be done earlier.

An RFC can't drive a business decision; however, it can bring out risks that were not considered before. Thus, it can urge people to reconsider their decision. But that shouldn't be the goal of an RFC; it's only a good side effect.
