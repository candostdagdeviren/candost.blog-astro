When a request is made to a [layered architected](/notes/47a/) service, if the request has to go through all the [layers](/notes/47a1/) without applying any business logic, the situation indicates an *architecture sinkhole anti-pattern*. This pattern happens often. The healthy ratio is 80%-20%; a maximum of 20% of the requests having sinkhole anti-pattern is considered healthy.

Although it looks like it is happening more in layered architectures, I also saw it often happening in technically distributed architectures such as VIPER architecture in iOS. VIPER is especially criticized for this anti-pattern.
