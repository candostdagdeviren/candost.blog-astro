When someone tries to teach something to another person, they find out missing knowledge about the topic. They learn better. The framework you teach doesn't matter. You can record a screencast, write a blog, or give a talk, it doesn't matter. And even you don't have to publish these. Just prepare them like you're gonna publish them. By doing this, you'll learn a lot of details about the topic you are working on.
