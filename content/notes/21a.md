When we're onboarding, we often don't know the domain and the system. On a personal level, we have many known unknowns. If we're a junior developer, then we have many unknown unknowns. That's why mentoring and code review helps a lot in figuring out what we didn't know. Especially for junior people, it's a great strategy to learn because they don't know if something exists. When a person starts getting experienced in the job, their unknown unknowns in their domain or tech stack start dissolving. However, when they pick something new, the same thing starts again. The code review process helps to share knowledge. If we share our knowledge, we might solve someone else's unknown unknown.
