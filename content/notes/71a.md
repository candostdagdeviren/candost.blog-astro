>...there is such a thing as good or bad transparency. Good transparency answers questions before they come up, brings people along, and encourages consistent and principled decision-making across the organization. Bad transparency distracts people, invites the wrong questions, treats information as currency, embraces gossip as truth, and results in politicking.

The main goal for transparency should be answering the questions before they arise. It's impossible to answer all questions by default; however, the good of transparency should encourage people to ask those questions. Then the person can enhance the level of transparency by clarifying unclear parts. Transparency is a framework for decision-making; it should focus on enabling everyone to make better decisions.
