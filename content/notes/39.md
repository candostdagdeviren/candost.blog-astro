There is a sweet spot in optimizing for quality. The further you try to maximize something, the less benefit you get. At some point, the quality becomes useless and only serves as an art piece. This applies to many things, such as writing, architecting software systems, coding, etc. We need to carefully analyze the relation between the cost and the quality and try to keep it balanced.
