"Here are a few things that helped me. Do you think any of them might work for you?" is often implicit. (Use the question instead of giving recommendations or commands.) When it's implicit, people don't understand and become resistant to changing their behavior. Also, even when implicit, there are people easy to change when the motivation comes from their manager, whom they trust.
