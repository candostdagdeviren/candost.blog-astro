Accountability, in a teamwork context, means holding each other accountable and calling each other on our actions, behaviors, and performance that might hurt the team.

When people avoid this type of call-on, they actually avoid their internal discomfort, they avoid confrontation.

On the peer level, I rarely did thisâ€”calling people on. But giving feedback is a big part of it. When we give feedback, we're holding other people accountable. Regardless of their intention to be accountable or not, that's what we do. If they don't feel accountable still, it impacts the team more. Because not having this skill creates dysfunction in the team and prevents the team from succeeding.
