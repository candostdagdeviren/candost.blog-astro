Event Storming is a component discovery technique from Domain-Driven Design. An architect assumes that the system will use events and messages. Together with the team, they identify which events will occur and how these events will be handled. They design the components around these events and message handlers. This technique can be pretty helpful for distributed architectures (e.g., microservices).
