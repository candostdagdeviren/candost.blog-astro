When I started thinking about my feedback and how can I give it in the Radical Candor framework, my feedback already improved because I had to think about challenging people and caring about them. I realized that I already care about people; my only missing part was challenging them directly. Now, I'm looking for ways to challenge people.

Caring about people is often [seen as a weakness](/can-you-fire-your-colleague/) because professionalism doesn't include personal feelings a lot. But we're born with caring for others; we currently hide under the professionalism tag and use it as an excuse to be inhuman.
If we have a hard time giving feedback, we can think of a similar but simpler situation and apply techniques from the simpler situation to the complicated one.

In the end, "If you are holding an authoritative position, just say what you are going to say while giving a damn."
