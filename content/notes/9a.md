If you work alone all the time, you’ll never be a senior.

If you think you know the best, you’ll never be a senior.

If you always work with senior, staff, or principal engineers, you’ll never be a senior. You have to mentor, train, and coach other people.

If you jump on the hype train without giving it a thought, you’ll never be a senior developer.

If you don’t bother to explain your awesome technical solutions to non-technical folks, you’ll never be a senior
