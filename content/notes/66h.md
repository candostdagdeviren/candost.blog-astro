Organizations should influence people to write RFCs, and the guides to writing them should be simple, clear, and concise. If an RFC template has ten sections that *have to* be filled, it ceases to help.

An RFC template should be flexible. It's there to guide people's thoughts. A template should not only make writing easier but also understanding easier.

I still recommend the NABC Model (Need, Approach, Benefits, Competitors) that Stanford introduced. It's short and guides people in a direction where it's easy to understand.
