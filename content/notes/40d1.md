When we receive feedback, we might consider applying it fully or declining it. It often looks like a 0 or 1 situation; take it or leave it. Even when we try to find the middle ground, it comes down to picking up what's useful in feedback (only a small part) and applying it to our lives. If we're unsure about the feedback, we hesitate to take anything out of it. But it doesn't have to be that way. We don't have to change our lives till eternity with some feedback we got over lunch. However, we can experiment. We can try making a small change on one or two occasions and see how it changes our behavior and its impact on us. If the change doesn't feel right or doesn't improve anything, we can always roll back. Thinking about the changes we need to make often prevents any improvement because changes are scary as the results are unknown. By experimenting, we reduce the unknown and can make improvements.
