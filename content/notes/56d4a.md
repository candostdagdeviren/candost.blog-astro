Platform teams have a lot of organizational work besides designing and coding the platform. Without organizational work, they cannot function well. Organizations have to ensure that platforms' APIs are well-designed and documented. Their consumers should start using the platform without the platform team's input and continue doing so. The only interaction between the platform and its consumers should be around understanding what consumer teams need so that platform's roadmap will be shaped efficiently. For platform teams to succeed on all fronts, organizations should keep them as fundamental.
