> "Every successful writing should leave the reader with one and only one thought, not two, not three, or five. One." â€” Zinsser

In non-fiction, it's tempting always to fire ideas and arguments to the reader. Some of them support the original idea and can be used. However, it's difficult to follow up on the second or third thought. Readers are left bewildered, and ideas don't have a great impact once there are many of them.
