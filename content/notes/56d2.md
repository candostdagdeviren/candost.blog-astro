Enabling teams consist of experts in a subtopic where deep expertise is required. These teams take pressure from [stream-aligned](/notes/56d1/) teams by doing research and guiding them in certain areas. Enabling teams join stream-aligned teams, share their knowledge, and leave. I've never come across any team like that. I believe these teams are more common in big companies where mid-size companies don't have enough people to fill this team. The business also cannot be in favor of these teams with a limited budget. If enabling team's mission is to help stream-aligned teams move faster, it might actually work with a limited budget by having short-living enabling teams.
