Giving ownership to people and delegating the work is one of the greatest ways to empower people.

I've grown in my career because my managers gave me the job and empowered me by making me the owner of the initiative, project, or piece of work. Once I owned it, I tried my best to do it well and finish it. After a while, I became reliable. So, delegating tasks to your employees enables them to grow, learn, and showcase their skills, and become reliable.

If you want projects moving and initiatives running, assign a responsible person to each. You cannot run every single piece by yourself as a leader. You don't have that capacity and expertise. Only involve yourself when they need you or when they are blocked. Let them make decisions, not you.
