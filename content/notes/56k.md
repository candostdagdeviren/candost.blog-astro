[Inverse Conway Maneuver](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-de/radar/techniques/inverse-conway-maneuver) doesn't work alone. Knowing [team interaction modes](/notes/56f/) and team types helps us use the Inverse Conway Maneuver to our advantage. As I'm not fully convinced that the Inverse Conway Maneuver will work, I cannot see how it can be implemented. Inverse Conway Maneuver can only work on high levels, and technical people often don't even have a seat on the table while designing teams. This situation can result in bad organization and, therefore, system design. When skilled and experienced software engineers are on the table, I can see this strategy working.
