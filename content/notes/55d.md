In hash partitioning, we use hash functions for ranges to distribute data evenly between partitions. The range-based partitions still have the disadvantage of loading one partition with more data. With hash functions, we solve this problem. Putting the identifier into a hash function produces a unique hash. We can then use this hash to write data to a related partition.
