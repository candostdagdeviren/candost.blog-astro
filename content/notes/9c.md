Simple ideas can prevent complicated problems. We often look for complex solutions because we want to be apart from the crowd. Simple ideas are available to everyone. They are often the first thing people learn. When we want to take an extra step, we search for complex answers. Yet, simple ideas do not only solve but also prevent facing these problems at the beginning. They eliminate the complications right at the start. That's why we must seek simple ideas and embrace simplicity.
