Habit stacking is a technique to tie a new habit into an existing one. Old habits already have cues everywhere. They have certain times and places embedded in them. Our habits work with cues coming from time and place. To form a new habit, instead of defining a specific time and location, we can simply attach the new habit to an existing one. To make it obvious, we can use the formula "After [old habit], I will [new habit]." The time and location are already embedded inside. For example, after I stop working, I will play bass guitar.
