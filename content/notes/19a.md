Choosing the technology, creating a new product, or even a company has its stages. In each stage, we figure out how to approach a problem. There are two different unknowns. We have known unknowns. We know that there is a thing we have to do, but we don't know how to do it or what happens if things go wrong. There are also unknown unknowns that we have no idea exist. New technologies often come with many unknown unknowns. We don't know what can go wrong.

We should not only be careful but also consider many different perspectives and take a look at the maturity of our new choice.
