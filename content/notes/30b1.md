In our everyday life, social media bombards us with happy moments. The protection of safe zones that we created for ourselves caused us to see reality less. Not experiencing the pain, we're losing the benefits of learning how to deal with it. Like babies not being exposed to germs early on and growing up being more vulnerable with a weak immune system, we're growing to suffer more and more from less important things. Social media, especially Instagram and TikTok, cause misconceptions about the real world. Yet, the reality is full of pain.
The important part is learning how to deal with this pain. If we avoid healthy doses of pain early on, we become extremely sensitive to any trivial pain. Our suffering bar gets lower day by day. We need to get the benefit of learning and experiencing healthy doses of pain early on to choose what to suffer from later on.
