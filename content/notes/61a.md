When deciding the person you're going to delegate the work, look for specific criteria and ask yourself a few questions:

- How much time would you spend when you delegate?
- How much time does this person require from you?
- How bad can their decisions be, and how can they impact you and the business?
- What are the results you expect after delegation?
