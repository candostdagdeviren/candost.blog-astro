When an authoritative figure (like a CEO or manager at work) gives feedback, the feedback usually has more weight. People often carefully listen. This situation creates a fallacy for leaders: when they give feedback, they expect that everybody will act on it. However, it's not true. Regardless of authority, if the receiver side doesn't take the feedback, nobody can force it, including the CEO. They can take action and give notice or even fire the person; however, there is literally nothing they can do besides threatening and forcing other people to take the feedback.
