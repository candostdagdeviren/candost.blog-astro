The focus is fundamental for achieving many things. Sticking to the values is one of them. Accepting a value requires saying no to the things that break the value. For example, if fidelity is one of our values, we will and need to, say no to any cheating in our relationships.

Saying yes and sticking to a thing requires saying no to many other things. Society—especially Western—nudges us to say yes to many things by embracing being part of it. People who say no or don't accept the yes-ism culture are considered outlanders. However, the true value comes from saying no. Always accepting and being in sync with everyone is not achievable, and even trying it is extremely tiring.
