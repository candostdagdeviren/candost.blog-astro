> We should try to repay what other person provided us.

We observe that the rule of reciprocation plays a big role everywhere. Almost all political environments work with this rule. We see a lot of corruption not because people are bad but because of the strength of this psychological rule. For example, with my not-so-strong knowledge, I can see that Tayyip Erdogan puts many incompetent people in certain positions, and those people become indebted to him. Then, they went to great lengths to repay their debt to Erdogan, doing whatever he asked of them. The people continue for a good length until they think they repaid the debt. Once they reach equality, thatâ€™s when they open their eyes, stay against him, and side with logic. Until then, the strength of the rule has even beaten the influence factor (whether they like Tayyip or not).
