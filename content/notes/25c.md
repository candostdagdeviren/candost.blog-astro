1. Don't slip away from your writing habit twice.
2. It's better to do it every time, even if you can't make it perfect or as much as you want. Just writing a small piece is better than not writing at all.
3. Don't fall into an all-or-nothing cycle. Do something small rather than fully neglecting it.
