Understand what kind of trust the person wants to build. If the person needs more "personal relationship," ask them how their kids or cats are doing. If they are more inclined to task-based trust, care about their goals, what is important to them and how they define a successful relationship (e.g., if someone says they don't want public praise, don't give them public praise. If they don't wish to public feedback, don't give them feedback in public).
