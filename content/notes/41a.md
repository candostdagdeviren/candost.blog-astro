When we start a hobby as an amateur, we are okay with dropping it or not doing it for a while. But we're not okay with failure. Wherever we have a setback or failure, we demoralize ourselves and have a really hard time standing up again.

At the same time, in our professional endeavors, we never drop. Even when we're not in the mood to go to work, unmotivated, frustrated, or have other feelings, we still get up and do the job. This difference in mindset makes everything different. What about if we choose some of our hobbies and approach them professionally? Instead of falling down in every negative feedback or getting demoralized when people don't care about us, we take them as feedback and still keep going.
