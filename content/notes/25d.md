Committing to something is perceived as limiting your options, limiting your freedom of choice. But committing brings freedom. Freedom from things that don't matter.

When there are many options for the same thing, we get stressed and cannot decide. Especially in the digital age, we are bombarded with different things that ask for our attention.

Committing to one thing means freedom from distraction. It enables us to work on one thing to excel at it. It keeps our attention on that and discards others.

Committing is saying no to many other things. It frees us, reduces our stress, and enables us to get better at the things we commit.
