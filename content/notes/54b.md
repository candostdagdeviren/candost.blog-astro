While trying to create a culture—a good one—a leader makes many mistakes, that's normal and unavoidable. Learning from these mistakes is what makes everything different. Learning comes from making things wrong to make them right.

As a leader, you cannot avoid building a culture. If you don't care about the culture, it will build itself, and most probably, it won't be the one you wanted. That's why it requires constant effort and investment. The culture will reflect leadership, regardless of whether you want it or not.

Invest in your culture. Make mistakes and learn from them. Make mistakes to learn the right way. Don't let things go as they are in the middle of the way. You can't take a step and stop in the middle. If you do, your culture will also reflect that.
