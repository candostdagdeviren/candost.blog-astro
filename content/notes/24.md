People have different motivation drivers. However, when we form teams, they are motivated by team goals. Individual goals follow behind the team goals. Without an aim for the team to go, they cannot feel successful. No one wants to be in a ship that is just floating in the middle of the sea. If people don't know where they are headed, they won't follow at all.
