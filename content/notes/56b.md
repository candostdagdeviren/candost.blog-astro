There is an understanding that the more communication between teams and people, the better the work. Within the teams, this holds. However, leaders must be mindful of the communication overhead and its impact. When we unnecessarily create communication lines between teams, we are prone to develop systems that support these communication lines (a.k.a. [Conway's Law](/notes/56a/)). When we limit the communication between teams, we force the teams to create specific API boundaries and documentation to remove the need for communication. When the communication line is open, people will use it instead of relying on APIs and documentation. The team that offers API will also use these communication lines instead of working on a better API design or documentation.
