When [Patrick Rothfuss wrote about Auri](https://kingkiller.fandom.com/wiki/Auri), he didn't tell a story. He defined a person. Auri is still a mystery and will always be. She figured things out in her world away from everyone, and she often understood how things should be. Everything has a purpose. Not every nice thing has to be used and owned by someone. Some things belong where they are, but finding exactly where they belong takes energy and time. When Auri finds something new, she spends good thinking about giving it to the right place where that thing can serve a purpose even though nobody knows the purpose; that thing just *feels* right to stay at that place. That's perhaps how things should be. We just need to *feel right* where we are or where we belong without explaining why we feel right.

<summary>Background story</summary>
When Auri found a new room and inside a drawer full of clean and high-quality sheets, I loved how she didn't touch them. Because she knew that it was going to corrupt her and break her spirit, some things were supposed to be that wayâ€”choosing not to own every beautiful thing while knowing you would definitely benefit from it.
