Reactions to feedback define how the feedback giver perceives the other person's feedback-receiving skills. When people react with anger or cry when they receive harsh feedback, it creates a picture of how they cannot handle the feedback. These various behaviors are the feedback footprints that are unique to the individual. Many people are not aware of their *feedback footprint* and are not ready to face harsh feedback. Asking, "How do I typically behave when I receive feedback?" is a good strategy to help anyone learn their unintentional behaviors. After learning the reactions, it will be easier to prepare for any kind of feedback and easily handle difficult situations.
