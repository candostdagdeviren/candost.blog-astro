The questions that we need to answer after inspectional reading shows how much we need to get to know or understand the book. I say get to know because some books cannot be understood in the first reading and demand analytical reading. However, the majority of the books require only part of the inspectional readingâ€”systematic skimming. Looking at the title, subtitle, preface, table of contents, index, publisher's blurb, and reading a few pages here and there (the chapters pivotal to arguments) can already help us understand what kind of book it is, what the book as a whole about and what's the structural order of author's ideas and how they are presented. When this is not enough, we need to read the book quickly from cover to cover. There are also not so many books that require reading even once. When we read, we shouldn't stop and ponder on arguments; just continue and finish to get to know the book as a whole.
