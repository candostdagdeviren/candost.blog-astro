Avoid snack work
> *Snack work*: Doing side tasks like founding a book club (while you're under the stress of a high workload in your team) when it doesn't make sense.

Your energy levels are insufficient, and you cannot run the club sustainably. This type of work—snack work—requires low effort. That's why it's so attractive. But it also has a low impact. If you only eat snacks, it won't fulfill you. Snacks are just short-term solutions. Sometimes [you have to have them](/newsletter/mektup-23/), but you have to be careful. You don't want to find a book club, moderate other teams' retrospectives, and do your main work at the same time for long periods. You need to [focus](/deciding-on-what-you-should-focus-on-next/) and [manage your energy](/newsletter/mektup-46/). You also have to reevaluate snack work all the time. If you receive a promotion, your snack work definition will also change.
