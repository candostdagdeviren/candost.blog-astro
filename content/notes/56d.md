The pre-maturely decided team structures often fail sooner than expected. Teams have to be formed around a vision of a domain. While forming any team, we must consider which dependencies the team will have, the cultural and technical maturity of team members, and the organization's size. We must make conscious decisions about the silos we create or break down. We have to form the team for long-term solutions, not short-term ones.
