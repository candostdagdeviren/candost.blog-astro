Three levels (outcome, process, identity) of change define our success in changing habits. These are like onion layers. Changing outcomes is the outer layer, such as losing weight. Changing processes is the middle layer, such as the eating system. Changing identity is the inner layer, such as our self-image or the world view. So, outcomes are what you get, processes are what you do, and identity is what you believe.
