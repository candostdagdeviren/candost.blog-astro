> "You have to fall in love with boredom."

This sentence has many aspects. Producing something valuable and being a creator requires dealing with boredom. Having a deep life with meaning requires knowing and facing boredom. For example, if you want to improve your writing, there are many days that you will look at the empty page for a long time. If you distract yourself and check social media, you will not write anything. Embrace boredom so that you can do some exercises over and over and over again, even if you are not in the mood to do them. "The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom."
