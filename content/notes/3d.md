Empowerment doesn't work without clarity and competenceâ€”empowerment results from a top-down structure. We need emancipation instead of empowerment. An emancipated team doesn't need empowerment. Because they don't need the power from the leader, when they have emancipation, they can act freely. Since they are competent and there is a clear goal, they have the power on themselves to make better decisions.
