Writing up evaluations of 1, 3, and 5 years later and thinking ahead clears the mind and creates achievable goals. At the same time, these goals need to be measurable. We can't say "improve test results" as a goal. We need to define how much we want to improve. Is it 30% or 50%? And these goals have to be aligned with the bigger goals of the organization.
