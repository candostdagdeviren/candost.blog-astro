For [team interaction modes](/notes/56f/) to work, managers have to work on creating the environment and consistently (and sometimes with big-bang changes, sometimes with deliberate actions) work on setting the expectations for the team. The managers should bring clarity and support people in their expected path. For example, if one team should work in [facilitating interaction mode](/notes/56i1/), the manager should work with individuals to improve their mentoring, coaching, and facilitation skills. Each interaction mode requires different skill sets, and the [manager's job](/notes/3/) is to identify which skills are needed and support the individual growth.
