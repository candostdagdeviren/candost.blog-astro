Be honest and admit when you don't know. Accept that the team consists of experts who know the work better than you. As long as they see that you are trying to get better at what you do and [you're being empathetic](/the-must-have-skill-for-every-leader-listening-with-empathy/) towards the team you're managing, they will trust you. Be honest and open with the team.
