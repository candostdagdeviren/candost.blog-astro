Contradictions within the slip-box can be discussed further in the thought line. We find (and discover) opposite thoughts when we try to place the note in the slip-box. The most important part is connecting the note with as many thoughts as possible (while keeping a close relationship). However, it doesn't mean that opposing thoughts can't stay together. We can still discuss the contradiction within a line of thought.
