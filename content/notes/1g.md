Achieving goals are only for the moment. Winners focus on the systems and how to improve them. Losers only focus on the goal. Once they reach the goal, they are done. Winners are never done. Because the goals create "Either-or" conflict, it doesn't bring endless happiness. Setting goals means winning the game. When we focus on building systems and our mechanisms, we stay in the game.
