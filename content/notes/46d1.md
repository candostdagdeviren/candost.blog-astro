When we evaluate ourselves, we put some measurements. Depending on the measure, we feel satisfied, happy, and fulfilled. The measurements directed to self-worth--how much we feel valued by ourselvesâ€”usually come from negative experiences. It doesn't arise from how we feel happy or entitled to be happy, but rather what we hide beneath. How we feel about our negative experiences shows us our true self-worth. The person who has high self-worth can look at themself and say; yes, this is where I'm weak or vulnerable.
