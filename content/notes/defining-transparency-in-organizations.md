Content-level transparency is an easier to achieve and helpful for anyone to find information easily. There are less hidden information and individuals don't need to talk to anyone to learn what's going on *as the work is happening*. The content is public, accessible, readable, and searchable to anyone anytime, not when the information holder decided to make it available.
I think it's the ultimate culture change that can boost structural transparency. If anyone can find and read whatever is going on in an organization's other corner at any time (in the raw form), it will also push other parts of the organization to increase their content-level transparency and the organization can increase their structural-transparency.

The benefits are also cumulative: people spend less time building trust with each other, politics are reduced; collaboration focuses on creative pursues instead of knowledge-sharing; everyone stays honest; people can observe what/how others are doing freely.
