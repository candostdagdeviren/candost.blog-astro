## Improve Competency with Mechanisms

Improving competency on technical topics should be supported with mechanisms. Mechanisms ensure that technical knowledge expands. These mechanisms include:

- [32A](/notes/32a/) Saying the message once is not important
- Taking deliberate action
- Learning at every opportunity
- Certifying the learning (tests) and competency
- [24B](/notes/24b/) Specifying goals, not methods. (This is especially amazing. When we specify methods, we forget why we are doing what we are doing.)
