We believe that our minds and, therefore, behaviors are not changeable. On the contrary, they change a lot in our lifetime. We have this firm belief, especially when we are stuck with critical thoughts about ourselves. These critical thoughts come from authoritative figures in our lives. They have an impact when they criticize usâ€”even with good intentions. These people can be our parents or teachers. Once the mind has these critics, it doesn't mean they are irreplaceable. If we constantly repeat them, they will always be there. But if we can make our minds think new thoughts, we already start preventing these critical thoughts and improve our creativity. Our minds are biologically changeable; it's called neuroplasticity. We're not born with critical thoughts. Our minds changed on the way, and they can change again.
