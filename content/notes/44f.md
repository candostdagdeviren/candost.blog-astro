When Simon Sinek recommended [starting with why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/), there was a reason behind it. One of the arguments he had was, *"With a clear WHY, everyone inside the company will be able to make decisions as clearly and as accurately as the leader."* When the why is unclear, people tend to focus on why they should do something in that way or another way. Unclear direction creates adversaries. An unclear mission creates relationship conflicts. The reason should always be clear when we want to do something. Then, the discussions can focus on how to do that thing. Focusing discussions on HOW improves the outcome because it promotes [task conflicts instead of relationship conflicts.](/relationship-vs-task-conflicts/) Leaders should always clarify the WHY part so that the team can focus on HOW to do things.
