Many organizations adopt the Request for Comments (RFC) culture. Creating knowledge silos and building software in a team without involving others is unavoidable in organizations. That's why organizations create RFC processes to break down silos, collect feedback early and prevent impediments that can come out later in developmentâ€”which usually are very expensive to solve.

Many mid-to-big organizations later aim to create governance around the RFC process and give guidance to the people by templates and defined RFC phases. In some organizations, the RFC process is also used as a decision-making mechanism, in which the whole process is doomed to fail. Even though I love the RFC process and have even introduced it to an organization before, I see a lot of traps that people fall into.
