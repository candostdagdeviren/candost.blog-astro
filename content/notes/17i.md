LifeLabs Learning developed a rubric to define four kinds of feedback on a public talk.

- Hearts ♥️: Positive, but not specific. (I liked your talk)
- Diamonds ♦️: Positive, specific, and actionable. (Your talk is good. If you do this, it can be great)
- Spades ♠️: Negative, actionable suggestions.
- Clubs ♣️: Negative, not specific or constructive.

Always look for Diamonds♦️ and Spades ♠️.
