As we evolved, we developed autopilot behaviors to eliminate suffering and details in our lives. We cannot care about every problem, so we—humans—have built systems in our brains to take shortcuts. These systems turned into issues and biases (also [Kahneman talks about Heuristics](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557/thinkingfastandslow)).  If we're not mindful of these autopilot behaviors, many of our day-to-day [decisions](/notes/19/) will be false and even can lead to horrible situations. Once we understand how we behave in some instances, we can design our lives and make decisions to improve them. When [Tim Ferriss wrote about a decision that removes hundreds of decisions](https://tim.blog/2020/01/20/one-decision-that-removes-100-decisions/), the idea was the same—using our brain's auto-pilot mechanism to [develop helpful habits](/notes/27/).

The same situation also happens when we [switch careers](/notes/10/). We need to break some of our habits and develop new ones, such as giving input when we shouldn't.
