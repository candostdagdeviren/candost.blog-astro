James Clear says, "You're more likely to unlock a big leap in performance by trying differently than by trying harder. You might be able to work 10% harder, but a different approach might work 10x better. Remain focused on the core problem, but explore a new line of attack. Persistence is not just about effort, but also strategy. Don't merely try harder, try differently."

I'm unsure how much it holds true, but we gain a lot of advantages from retrospectively observing what we have done and seeking changes where needed. Stopping the action, powering it through, and looking into what has been done so far brings many benefits and helps us to course-correct.
