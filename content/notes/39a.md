Engineers often struggle to explain their train of thought. They create processes and systems in their minds but fail to explain them using simple sentences. Good engineers often become terrible communicators and collaborators not because of their limitations in thinking but because of limitations in explaining their decisions. They make good judgment calls and decisions but fail to adapt these decisions to changing situations. Especially when teams form best practices, these practices become the worst after a while because nobody has the guts to rethink them and improve them. They accept them as best practices and use them without reviewing them.
