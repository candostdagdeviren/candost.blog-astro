When you get a delegated task, get as much information as possible. Ask what the manager has in mind to complete this task. How would *your manager* approach the task? There are multiple ways they delegate the task to you. Clarify their expectations.

- Do they want completed work returned for confirmation?
- Do they delegate everything and trust you to do the job and they don’t mind seeing the result?
- Do they want you to come up with a plan before the execution and get a confirmation?
- Do they want you to come up with a plan only for optional feedback but you’re free to go to the execution?

There are many ways to delegate and it also depends on the relationship and the task at hand. So if you’re a manager, be clear about what you delegate to a person. Make everything clear in the beginning so that you won’t have any problems later on. Make sure that you won’t block your direct report.

People sometimes don't complain even if the delegation is not clear. It doesn't mean that that is a problem. When something is not right, it will come back to you. Don't stress over it.
