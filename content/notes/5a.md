People who grew quickly but have struggled in their position perform badly because of a couple of reasons: they might be in the wrong role. An engineer getting a promotion to manager because they were excellent is an example. Find the right role for these people. The second reason can be that they are new to the role, and therefore, too much happens too fast that they can't handle it. Clear out expectations in these cases. Setting the ground right will help them to learn and prioritize. Another reason can be personal problems. They might have difficult situations in life; just wait in this case. And the other reason can be that they are a poor fit for the company or the team. Either fire them or change their team. Keeping these people will be detrimental to everyone, including the person.
