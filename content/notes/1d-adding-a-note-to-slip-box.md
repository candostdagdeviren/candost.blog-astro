When we try to place a new note, the slip-box's chain-of-notes strategy forces us to think about the connections with other notes, including unrelated ones.

Instead of directly relating the note to something, we are nudged not to fit the idea into the existing line of thought and create a new line of thought. That's the beauty of Zettelkasten.
