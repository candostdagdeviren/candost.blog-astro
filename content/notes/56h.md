Creating an X-as-a-service team communication mode has advantages and disadvantages. The biggest con I see is the operational cost of setting the team up. The forming stage requires deliberate actions and doing them consistently in a changing business environment. When the business doesn't think of the platform as a product (which often happens), the results are heartbreaking. The initial stage of the X-as-a-service team should be well-managed and supported by the organization.
