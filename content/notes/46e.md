Happiness without any problems is improbable. Instead of focusing on removing all the problems, we should focus on which problems to tackle. Because if we try to solve every single issue, we won't have any energy left. Also, big goals often have many struggles that lead to them. By only choosing to deal with certain struggles, we can access our goals.

Good goals are more important ones and change from person to person. Upon choosing good problems, we can experience happiness consistently.
