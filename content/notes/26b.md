Big batch-size deployments lower the feedback cycle. With small batch deployments, we can get feedback early on in the product. With big batches, we wait for the deployment date. And if everything goes well, we start getting feedback. Adjusting the product according to the feedback takes even more time because we wait for the next deployment. It causes to have bad product decisions.
