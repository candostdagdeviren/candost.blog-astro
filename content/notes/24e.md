Recognizing the rock stars (excellent performance/gradual growth trajectory) is tricky because leaders often misunderstand these people and want to reward their performance. These leaders err in reward and give promotions while the person is not looking for a promotion. Promotion kills these people's motivation. They are looking for different challenges. One of the best ways to recognize these people's success is by asking them to teach what they know to inexperienced people. But also never forcing them to teach. If they don't want to, they should never be forced. Leaders should respect.

Finding opportunities for these people is the delicate and difficult part of being a manager for these people. Identifying what can work and what cannot is challenging and requires a lot of conversations with these people and others.
