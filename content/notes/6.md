> "Being a boss is a job, not a value judgment."

Many leaders mix these two and think of the word boss as something negative because it gives a superior feeling. The bosses who get carried away with this feeling begin to think they are smarter than everyone. It results in them not caring about the team members personally. Feeling superior also brings the "professional" tag. When leaders think that they stay within professional lines, it prevents them from caring about their reports personally. Being professional is different than acting professionally. When leaders act professionally and don't care about people personally, they also cannot expect their reports to be professional and care about them. When the boss doesn't fully show themselves, the reports won't show themselves either.
