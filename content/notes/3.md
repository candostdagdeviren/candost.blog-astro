We can summarize the manager's job as helping people execute in the best way by clearing out the blockers and ensuring they grow while bringing success to the business.

Managing a team comes with challenges. The team might face blockers, can steer away from the goal, or can get stuck. There are many unknowns, and it's the beauty of it.

There are known knowns, such as things to do in the projects, and known unknowns, such as how to give feedback and personal growth. The manager knows their existence and, sometimes, how to approach these, but the possible result is often unknown.

There are also unknown unknowns. For instance, introducing new technology to an organization. New technologies come with many unknown unknowns; there are many things we don't even know they exist. Engineers and managers can not know every single detail, especially if the technology is new in the industry. If you're a manager, steer away from unknown unknowns or take small steps to convert them to known unknowns.

If you're joining a team, know your unknowns or try to figure them out.
