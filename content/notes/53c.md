When a person wants to change something and consult us as a coach or manager, summarizing their request helps clarify what we understand from their desire to change and catch any misunderstandings. As guides (or coaches), we're not done until the other person reaches their goals. It tends to stop after the person changes their idea, but without them being done, we cannot be done. Our goals have to align in the end. Otherwise, nobody will change their mind.
