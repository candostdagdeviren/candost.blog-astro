Database denormalization means adding redundant information into a database to speed up reads. For example, duplicating data across tables is a denormalization process. We duplicate data to reduce Join operations across tables.

When the databases grow, join operations become slower. To avoid this, we either use denormalization or NoSQL. NoSQL is designed differently and has no join operation.
