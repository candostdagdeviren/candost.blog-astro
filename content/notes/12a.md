When an engineer [gains](/notes/10a/) more autonomy, their decisions have a greater impact and become more important. It's crucial to develop decision-making skills to make the best decision in various situations. Humans mostly belong to one of three different groups when making decisions: ethical reasoning (evil/good), following the tribe they belong to, and using mental models. Many software engineers stick to their tribes (often following what's hype at that moment) and destroy the growth advantage they have. Some engineers make decisions for ethical reasons. When [engineers grow](/notes/11/), they have to be aware of why they make a decision and understand their decisions' flaws and blind spots.
