If you want to learn something and grow yourself on that topic constantly, you need to keep your learning level in the "just manageable difficulty." If the challenge is too hard, it demotivates you. If it's too easy, you get bored. This is called The Goldilocks Rule. If you are learning how to write code, don't try to do it all at once. Take a very small step and learn it until it starts to be boring.
