We might not intend to do something, but the situation can develop so that our behavior impacts others differently than our intention. That's why we often say or hear that "I know their intentions are good, but they shouldn't behave in that way."

Our behaviors affect others, not our intention. How do we align our intention, behavior, and impact on others? Looking from a different perspective is the first step to aligning intentions and their impact. Our brains evolved in a way that we don't hear our sounds or see our body language. To bypass this, we can record ourselves and watch later to realize how we behave, respond to someone, and react to events.
