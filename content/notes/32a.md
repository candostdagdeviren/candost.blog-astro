People forget. If we want people to change their minds or apply a new method, there is no other way than continually and consistently repeating the message. They will eventually learn by hearing when the message is resistant. The problem is not their competence. When we want to give a message that they should follow, what alternative do we have? Changing the message will only create confusion and a lack of direction.
