We always have to choose if we care about something or not. We decide to have a particular perspective on different things. Even when we don't choose anything, it's still a choice by its nature. The reality is that choice is unavoidable. It is why we should move our focus to how and what we choose. If why we choose something is clear and aligned with good values, we can become happier. If we decide on something with our shitty values, then there is a high chance that we won't feel that much satisfied. That's why [figuring out the values](/notes/30c/) and making mindful decisions are crucial for happiness.
