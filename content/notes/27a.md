Naming the actions, especially the ones we do without thinking, increases the consciousness of the action. When we repeatedly do the same actions, we start to form habits. In Kahneman's words, our actions move to system one (conscious) from system two (automatic) ([Thinking, Fast and Slow by Kahneman](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557/thinkingfastandslow)) when we get used to them. However, when we point to the action and call it (Pointing & Calling strategy), we become aware of our actions (move back from system two to one) and reduce the chance of making mistakes. Japanese underground train drivers, pilots, and many more professionals are using this technique to increase awareness on the job.
