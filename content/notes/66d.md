As the business decision has already been made, the RFC authors can decide which piece of feedback they will accept and which ones they will reject. If a team writes an RFC, they don't have to agree or accept every change request, but they have to acknowledge every comment. They have the right to veto by giving a reason. And the reason can be simple: "We're aware of its drawbacks, we acknowledge it, but we're willing to take this risk. We'll continue with the existing design."

There is no need to form a consensus for every topic. The RFC system works with consent-based decision-making by default, and teams should seek consensus only *and only* when they need it.
