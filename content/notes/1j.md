There is no happiness without suffering. Also, suffering is not suffering while trying to reach a goal and thinking that we will be happy when we get it. The whole idea of happiness (the imagination) we await in reaching our goals is problematic. When we reach a goal, we are happy only for a moment; our emotions are always temporary. After that moment, emotions are gone, and we're back to suffering again for the next goal, along with an expectation of happiness. All social media tricks us to that point, with everyone displaying their happy moments and convincing us that the full-happiness is possible. But to show off those happy moments, what did the other person suffer from? What pain did they have? We don't think they had any pain, and this point causes a lot of psychological problems.
