As you are born, the cards are already dealt in your life. You may be lucky and get a good hand, or you're out of luck and have a bad hand. The reality is these are not our choices. However, having a bad hand doesn't mean that you will lose the game of poker. Your strategy is your choice. Ultimately, you're responsible for choosing how you will approach playing with that hand.

The same applies to life as well. If you are not in a good position from the beginning, you will have a good or bad life depending on how you want to live. If you choose shitty values, it's your responsibility. When you choose to move on after a bad thing that's not in your control, you can have a better life. If you choose to [blame yourself](/notes/23e/) for what happened, although you didn't choose it and didn't have an impact on it, you are responsible for having a miserable life. The choice is yours, and you're responsible for it. Choose good values and measurements over bad ones to stop yourself from complaining all the time.
