In the feedback discussion, there are relationship triggers. The feedback comes from our relationship with another person. In this kind of feedback, one person starts giving feedback. The other person responds with a totally unrelated thing to the feedback; they switch track of the conversation. It's similar to the railroad switch tracks. One example would be a couple. One person buys a bouquet for the other, but the other person told before that they don't like bouquets and starts complaining that no one listens to them. The person who gives the flowers says that they do not appreciate it. Here, the person who gives the bouquet switches the track. The feedback becomes you vs. me while focusing on different subjects.
