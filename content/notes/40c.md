Focus on how to pull feedback instead of giving feedback.

Master the pulling feedback skills that drive our learning and curiosity. We always focus on giving effective feedback, yet whoever receives it is more important to hand over the feedback right. The teacher gives the same lesson to all students. It's how you learn to pull the information that makes you learn and be successful in class. The same applies to my whole life. We learn by pulling the feedback even in the toughest situations, such as when we're not in the mood or it's delivered poorly. Then you will learn and feed your curiosity.
