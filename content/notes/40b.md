We create accidental adversaries because of a lack of clarity or confusion in roles. When roles are not clear, we confuse the other side. That's why the feedback we get may feel off-point; when responsibilities and roles are unclear, who is responsible for answering support requests? When these kinds of things are unclear, the expected things from us will also be unclear. In these situations, it's better to take a step back and ask, â€œHow are our roles contributing to how we see each other? How do we give feedback to each other?"
