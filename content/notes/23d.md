When we give feedback to each other, we sometimes get stuck in the feedback. I once had a direct report asking me to give feedback in their first month on the team. I focused on giving *something* as feedback. When we focus on delivering feedback about what they are doing wrong while we have nothing to say, we get stuck. We need to take a step back and look at what each of us is contributing to the work and collaboration. This strategy helps us to find what's going well and what's not. When we do this, we see common patterns. Instead of giving empty and wrong feedback, we can deliver meaningful feedback.
