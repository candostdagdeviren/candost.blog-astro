To talk about increasing load and scalability, we first need to define the system's _current_ load. There is no one way of doing it as it depends on the project and its architecture, but we use _load parameters_. These parameters will be different for every application.

When we think about Twitter, the load parameter is not how many tweets are posted per second alone because it's not a high number that requires scaling the whole system. If there are 12000 tweets (write operation) per second, it's easy to handle. The load parameter for Twitter is the [_fan-out_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out_(software)) effect of posting tweets. Each Twitter user follows many people, and each user is followed by many. How to build this system with 12000+ incoming tweets every second is the scalability problem of Twitter.
