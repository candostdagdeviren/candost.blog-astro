_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about?ref=candost.blog), and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about?ref=candost.blog), too.)_

- Lately, I've been delving myself into indie web to discover other bloggers. I found a lot of cool people around the web. This was something I sought for long time; after closing most of my social media accounts. While social media reduces my attention span and keeps me stuck in not-so-great ideas, blogs bring a lot of great ideas as blogging requires more quality writing.
- I also started contributing more to the web by writing more, especially to my journal (instead of tweets or mastodon entries).

## Reading

- I am still reading Plato's Republic for the first time. I had a feeling that it will take a lot of time to read. My hunches were correct, after 8 months, I'm half way in.
- I started re-reading Fundamentals of Software Architecture because I am planning to join a book club who talks about this book. It will be a slow re-read for me and I'm mostly interested in discussions.

## Work

I am still working as [an Engineering Manager at SumUp](/joining-sumup). I’m working with a fantastic team that processes billions of events and operates on a scale.

There is not so much I can write about work here but one thing I'm thinking about these days is pumping up my team's performance, reducing tech debt, and increasing the talent density in the team. If you have any strategy that worked for you, send me an email at candost at candostdagdeviren dot com.

## Family and Friends Time

I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and loving—a fantastic human being.

I also spend time with my friends, better called my selected family, as they are fantastic people. I have a few new friends I got in Berlin, and spending time with new people is exciting.
