- During the vacation, I spent a significant amount of time during this break to publish all my notes in my Zettelkasten on this blog. Right now, I'm so relieved that [all notes are public](/notes/).

- We're coming to the end of the season for our regular Dragon Boat Mondays due to the weather getting dark earlier. We wanted to join a Regatta and race with other paddlers, but we couldn't find enough people for a big Dragon boat that needs at least 16 people to paddle.

- Adding a Journal section to my blog relieved me a little bit and helped me publish shorter posts. I want to use it like I would use social media: Post day-to-day things that are still well-written and well-thought-out but not spent too much time on them. I hope it will help me get better at writing overall.

## Reading

- I finished Peter Bichsel's Kindergeschichten. Fantastic book, great stories that are not only meant for kids but also for adults.
- I started reading Plato's Republic for the first time. I have a feeling that it will take a lot of time from me. Let's see.
- I also began reading Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi, making it my first Japanese Novel. My wife recommended it to me after reading it, and so far, it's good!

## Work

I am still working as [an Engineering Manager at SumUp](/joining-sumup). I’m currently working with a fantastic team that processes billions of events and operates on a scale.

There is not so much I can write about work here but one thing I'm thinking about these days is pumping up my team's performance. To do that, I need to find where the bottlenecks and constraints are. Maybe time for a re-read of The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt?

## Family and Friends Time

I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and loving—a fantastic human being.

I also spend time with my friends, better called my selected family, as they are fantastic people. I have a few new friends I got in Berlin, and spending time with new people is exciting.
