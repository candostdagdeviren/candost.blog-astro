## Life

- I regularly go to the gymâ€”4-5 times a week. That helps me to stay motivated and healthy. I started lifting weights three times a week. The other two days, I often do HIIT and endurance training.
- I started Dragon Boat again! Every Monday evening, I get together with a bunch of German-speaking people and jump on a dragon boat and paddle for 45-55 minutes. Itâ€™s challenging me both physically and also communicational-y.
- Lately, I started practicing bass guitar again. This time, I went with a less is more approach. I practice for 10-15 minutes strictly but every day. I donâ€™t want to rush anything. I take my time to learn. The only rule is to practice every day.
- I started takingÂ [AG1](https://athleticgreens.com/en)Â every day. I mainly take it for gut health. Vitamins and other ingredients are an addition to my goal. AG1 helps ease my mind that I get everything I need in one drink.
- Meanwhile, it has been a year since I stopped drinking alcohol. ðŸŽ‰

## Writing Daily

- As much as I have kept writing every day until now, itâ€™s been difficult lately to stay in the habit. There are too many distractions. Also, since I realized Iâ€™m writing 30 texts in parallel, I am trying to streamline them and finish posts I started months ago, if not years ago. Therefore, I am not writing every day anymore but trying to squeeze it into a few mornings within a week. The other mornings are for reading books and exercising. So, youâ€™ll see fewer posts on this blog compared to previous months and years.
- I started journaling again every day for ~30 minutes. I often end up writing one page in an A5 notebook.
- I still use pen and paperâ€”my favorite pen isÂ [Uni-ball Signo 207 blue](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B001IVOJDE/?ref=candost.blog), and my favorite notebooks areÂ [Moleskine Classic Softcover Black A4](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07Q8Q6J85/?ref=candost.blog)Â andÂ [Leitz Hardcover Pocket Notebook A6](https://www.amazon.com/Leitz-Notizbuch-Complete-liniert-schwarz/dp/B00DNTQMD4?ref=candost.blog).

## Reading

- Iâ€™m currently reading Designing Data-Intensive Applicationsâ€”the last three chapters are left! I alsoÂ [share my chapter notes on this blog](/books).
- I finishedÂ [How to Read A Book](https://oku.club/book/how-to-read-a-book-by-mortimer-j-adler-VtA3z?ref=candost.blog)Â for the third time. When I first read it, it gave me some ideas that I started applying. In the second reading, I learned much more and many other things I couldnâ€™t learn in the first reading. In the third one, I took many notes and will share them here once I finish editing them.
- I also finishedÂ [Thinking in Systems](https://oku.club/book/thinking-in-systems-by-donella-meadows-IEhaq?ref=candost.blog). A good book that taught me how everything actually is a system. It helped me change my perspective and understand contributing factors to any problem, challenge, or system.
- I also finished Measure What Matters andÂ [shared my notes here](/books/measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr-summary-review-and-book-notes/).
- I also finishedÂ [Extreme Ownership](https://oku.club/book/extreme-ownership-by-leif-babin-eSuxl). Iâ€™m currently extracting my notes and will share them here once Iâ€™m done.

## Work

I am still working asÂ [an Engineering Manager at SumUp](/joining-sumup). Iâ€™m currently working with a fantastic cross-functional team that processes billions of events and operates on a big scale.

There are so many challenges at work, and Iâ€™m learning a lot. I donâ€™t know how I can reflect on those learnings and write them here to share with everyone. Iâ€™m thinking about strategies but couldnâ€™t find anything so far.

Also, people living in Berlin returned to the office (three days a week), and Iâ€™m still not happy about it. But disagree and commit applies here. I disagreed and then committed.

## Family Time

I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and lovingâ€”a fantastic human being.
