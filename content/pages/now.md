- Vacation time. I am on vacation till September 26.

- During vacation, I came across Ayvalik International Film Festival and watched a few movies including a few short movies. I'll share my thoughts later on the blog.

- I spent significant amount of time during this break to publish all my notes in my Zettelkasten on this blog. Right now, I'm so relieved that [all notes are public](/notes/).


## Reading

- I finished Peter Bichsel's Kindergeschichten. Fantastic book, great stories that are not only meant for kids but also for adults.
- I started reading Plato's Republic for the first time. I have a feeling that it will take a lot of time from me. Let's see.

## Work

I am still working as [an Engineering Manager at SumUp](/joining-sumup). I’m currently working with a fantastic team that processes billions of events and operates on a scale.

There are so many challenges at work, and I’m learning a lot. I don’t know how I can reflect on those learnings and write them here to share with everyone. I’m thinking about strategies but couldn’t find anything so far.

## Family Time

I spend time with my wife, whom I love and who is empathetic, beautiful, intelligent, sensual, and loving—a fantastic human being.
