I always wonder how QR codes work and if I could understand myself. But I never even googled it (sometimes, it’s better to stay curious instead of directly reaching for information). While “walking” around the blogs and mastodon accounts, I came across [a post](https://qr.blinry.org) that literally explains how to read a QR code without any scanner. It’s fascinating to have people interested in and writing these kinds of things.

Did I need to know this information to continue with my life? Absolutely no. Did I really learn it and can decode a QR code? No. I will probably never try to decode a QR code by hand, but it was a fun read!
