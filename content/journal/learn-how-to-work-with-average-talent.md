Any leader in a mid-to-large-sized organization has to learn how to run a team or an organization with average talent.

You can't always hire the best of the best. You can't scale a team at a good hiring pace when searching for the best engineers. Even if you try, you'll make mistakes and hire an average or low-performer. Or, the best ones will have life circumstances that will make them average at some point.

Working with average-performing talent is unavoidable. Therefore, any leader must learn how to work with them.

A leader's job is to grow talent and help the team bring out the best in them. That demands recognizing which skills are missing in a team member and setting up the proper mentoring or coaching arrangement. Moreover, it requires setting the team culture correctly to allow this growth.

Only then can team performance start increasing. Only then can the team start looking into how they can improve their systems. Otherwise, the team will be doomed to failure as they try to solve issues with half-baked or mediocre solutions.
