Recently, we were talking with a few friends about what we would do if we won the Euro Jackpot. With the same friends, we also talked about defining retirement, and in there, we tried to be specific with defining the goal for retirement to find out how much money would be needed. All we wanted to find out was how we should invest our money today and what risk portfolio we should employ.

I have no answer to any of those. I still struggle with answering the first question, “What would I do if I retire today from a job I love doing?”

Well, I read [an article on The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/07/a-happiness-experts-frank-advice-for-joe-biden/678927/) (remove paywall [here](https://archive.is/Iv7DE)) that somehow touches these topics in the light of Biden’s latest debate on TV (I didn’t watch and also didn’t know about it until I read this article, and still don’t know how it went).

When I disconnect the article from Biden, the short interview gives food for thought in some other directions related to retirement.

A quote from which I learned Grihastha and Vanaprastha and related a lot:
> “…that many successful people get stuck in a stage called Grihastha—which is where you enjoy professional success and adulation—rather than progressing to Vanaprastha, which is where one should become more of a teacher (“crystallized intelligence”).”

A short and good read. Recommended.
