I pondered how I consume the latest or daily news and changed my habits (over the years).

I used to be glued to my phone, constantly scrolling through the news and feeling overwhelmed. But I realized I needed to take control. So, I decided to cut back on checking the news every day and instead set aside time once a week or every other week.

It was a game-changer. I no longer felt bombarded by the latest headlines or at the mercy of social media algorithms and lousy journalism.

As Schopenhauer said, "Not all writing is worth reading. Just because someone can put words on a page doesnâ€™t mean they are worth reading or add value."

Instead of daily news, I started seeking good journalists who take their time to develop an article. I also began reading articles that went deeper into the issues.

Moreover, I read them in my own time (instead of when they are sent to me).

And you know what? It's made a world of difference. I feel less stressed and more in control of my own thoughts. Instead of getting caught up in the noise, I'm able to focus on what really matters to me.

So, if you're feeling overwhelmed by the constant stream of news, maybe it's time to take a step back. What do you think?
