Have you ever observed how many times a leader needs to repeat a message for others to follow?

In any change, saying something once never works (at least, I've never seen it work).

It's not because people are incompetent or careless. It's because they forget.

If we, as leaders, want people to change their minds or apply a new method, there is no other way than continually and consistently repeating the message.

People will eventually learn by hearing it.

When we want or need people to change or adapt to change, what alternative do we have?

I've seen some leaders change their message (sometimes soften it) or choose another direction because they didn't get enough followers. And that created more confusion AND a lack of direction.

P.S. It's also reaaaally important to form the first decision and its message/communication correctly. If it's nonsense, nobody will follow, regardless of how often you say it. ðŸ˜…
