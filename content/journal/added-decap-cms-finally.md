I just added [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) to my blog. It's straightforward and helps me to post more on the go. I don't need a computer and commit everything manually to git. Decap syncs everything to the repository of this blog (which is publicly available [here](https://github.com/candostdagdeviren/candost.blog-astro)).

Then Netlify picks up the deployment and deploys the blog.

The authentication to CMS is also configured via Netlify and GitHub, making me love Netlify even more.

To add Decap to this [Astro](https://astro.build/) blog, I followed [this tutorial](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/) and used a few examples from [this blog article from Vercel](https://aalam.vercel.app/blog/astro-and-git-cms-netlify) to experiment.

I don't know why I waited so long and did not add a CMS to the blog (*I must admit that I liked writing blogs in VSCode, but a head-less CMS makes it easier to post things on the go*).
