Today marks a day for me. After days of manual labor and a lot of editing, I finally published all my notes in my Zettelkasten on my blog.

You can find all of them [here](/notes/).

It feels like it's opening years of work to the public. Although nobody will notice them, it's relieving to make them available for free to anyone. Hopefully, public notes will also nudge me to add more and more and keep better notes.
