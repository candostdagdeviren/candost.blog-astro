I remember when we tried to introduce the Request for Comments (RFC) process to an organization.

Well, we failed.

Here are ten things I've learned and still observe organizations making the same mistakes.

1. No business need, no RFC. Don't even bother writing about what you wish to change. There has to be a business need.
2. No prioritization, no RFC. If you do not implement RFC directly, your RFC will become invalid until that becomes a priority.
3. Never seek consensus. RFC operates with consent. Whoever wrote it has the decision. Disagree & commit.
4. RFCs are not for decision-making. A decision to tackle a problem has to be made before writing an RFC. RFCs focus on how, not if.
5. No extensive template. The Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) principle also applies. The simpler the template, the easier to write and read.
6. No rush. Don't open RFC for feedback for one day. Give enough time to review the RFC.
7. No repetitive communication, no feedback. Don't publish and wait. Proactively reach people to ask for their feedback again and again.
8. Choose your audience wisely. Not every RFC has to be shared with the whole company. Push RFCs to related people but be open to random people commenting on them.
9. If the organization's culture is full of bad politics and secrecy and people distrust each other, RFC will not survive for one second. Forget RFCs; fix your culture first.
10. No RFCs for premature organizations. RFCs might not be the best way to build things if you're looking for product-market fit with a limited runway budget.
