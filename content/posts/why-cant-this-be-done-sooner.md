There are questions with power. They are rare and challenge you to think deeply. The question, ["Why can't this be done sooner?" by Larry Page](https://review.firstround.com/speed-as-a-habit) is one of them. It makes you deeply understand the approach you're taking, question it, find the gaps in your knowledge and analyze the risks better so that you make [an informative decision while moving faster](/bias-towards-action). Yet, it doesn't ask to reduce the project's quality or scope; it's purely focused on understanding the limitations.

Fast-moving companies often neglect to grasp the reasons why things take longer than managers imagined. Managers tend to [lower-estimate](/timely-estimations-are-underrated) a software project than software engineers because they don't have sufficient information or technical limitations are not so obvious.

The limitations often play a significant role in software development. One of the biggest [debates](/how-to-stop-endless-discussions) is in quality vs. speed. While engineers want to deliver high-quality software, the product manager wants to deliver new features faster to compete in the market. However, it's challenging to achieve both at once. But once we know the limitations and risks, it's easier to [make decisions](/the-decision-making-pendulum) and deliver _faster_ _with quality_.

Uncovering risks and filling the knowledge gaps shape the [prioritization strategy](/prioritization-skills-for-senior-and-staff-software-engineers) and how to break down tasks. All software features and projects have multiple ways to split the work and deliver. Engineers can divide tasks according to the technical- or domain-driven design. Both strategies offer many different ways to build software. Finding out which one to use requires awareness of risks.

Let's think about the domain-driven approach. When the software team goes with a domain-driven approach, they split the problem into user journeys and business domain requirements instead of technical layers. We can think of each following box as one part of the domain requirements.

Sometimes the best solution, and often preferred one, is straightforward, following one block after another to build value for the customers and company.

A straightforward way satisfies all requirements. But when we want to deliver the project faster and ask, "Why can't this be done sooner? Why not?" we are forced to think of both alternative approaches and risks we currently have in our design. Once we identify them, we can choose another path and remove the risky or unnecessary blocks.

Despite the question, sometimes there is no change in the result at all. If we're able to answer with "Because of the reason X and dependency Y that we have no other choice," we're acting mindfully. The question makes us clearly see our risks and limitations and [communicate them](/communicating-decisions-in-the-organizations) to other people.

If there is a risk that we're hesitant to take, we focus on different strategies to mitigate the risks. The question doesn't give any hint about [changing the direction](https://mediations.candost.blog/p/18-managing-organizational-changes) to another way. To answer it, we need to truly understand why can't we do the job in any other way. Thinking about alternatives pushes us to [focus on the problem rather than blindly loving the solution](/14-lessons-i-learned-in-10-years).

When we focus on delivering early and understanding the risks clearly, the situation creates psychological safety. Early and smaller wins motivate us and increase dopamine in our bodies. Knowing risks and impediments early and [acting accordingly](/bias-towards-action) help reduce stress. As a result of delivering early, learning from users fast enables us to decrease the size of failures that might lead to stress and burnout.

The question is useable by both engineers and managers. While it provides managers the context and reasoning about the limitations, it also helps engineers understand the gaps in their knowledge and nudges them to look for other ways or strategies to [break down the project](/newsletter/mektup-6) to reduce risks.
