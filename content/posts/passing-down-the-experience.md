When I was in the tenth grade in high school, a man appeared next to our math teacher at the beginning of a class. I barely remembered his face then, but soon after introducing himself, I knew who he was as I had heard of him many times. He was one of the most successful graduates from our high-school, just graduated before I started.

That day was a surprise for me to see that guy because the lecture was Math, not a meet-with-graduates event. He answered a lot of questions coming from us. This conversation was one of my main reasons for choosing computer science. One guy, taking a bit of time from his life and answering random questions, had such a great impact on me.

Sixteen years later, I appeared in a class next to the same Math teacher (in Spring 2023). Although I am not as successful as the other guy, I still wanted to answer questions that students might have about computer science, programming, working abroad, and life in general. I wasn't surprised to see students' questioning eyes like I had had years ago. When I introduced myself and told them I'm a 2009 graduate, their eyes broadened because it's been so long. Their graduation year would be 2023. I told my short story and career. Then, we started an AMA.

So, many questions. About computer engineering. About university. About life. About Germany. About expat life, my salary, and even racism. I answered as much as I could with full transparency. I also shared my perspective on what lies ahead in front of them, just like the guy did when I was a student.

On my way back to Berlin, I thought about this experience I had while sharing what I've learned in sixteen years. Also, I realized how much fun our conversation was. The guy who appeared next to the same Math teacher probably had the same intentions as me as I passed down the experience to students who were about to become adults. We had the same experience.

Because they knew nothing about work.

Because they have seen only a little.

Because Turkish culture doesn't allow them to be adults until they reach their 20s.

Because they have a huge exam in front of them and racing with another million people and their only job is to study.

Because their only knowledge comes from people around them, who are biased by the environment.

Because they never get someone external to share knowledge.

Because they never expect to reach a person who once was sitting in the same seat.

What I shared and what the guy shared years ago was unbiased. I had no idea about any student's life situation. They asked me questions and the only bias I had was my life, which they wanted to learn anyway.

Some of the students had curious eyes and were careÂ­fully listening to every single word coming out of my mouth. Those curious eyes reminded me of something else.

Way way back when I was again in the same high school, but in my first year, we had a project for boarding schools in my hometown. These boarding schools consist of small kids coming from villages and living in dormitories to get an education when they are seven years old. Our project was going there in the evenings and helping them with their homework and explaining some topics they didn't understand in lectures during the day. The kids were poor, there were not enough teachers, and they didn't have access to enough resources. They also didn't have parents nearby. When we arrived there on the first day, their eyes were shining because they realized they were not alone in the evenings anymore. Instead of being alone in a fifty-bed room on their beds trying to spend time or study, they were with us, getting help on doing homework.

I saw the same shining curiosity and hunger for attention and information. When I passed down my knowledge and experience, both high school and boarding school students were smiling and all looked happy.

Last spring, I once again realized how valuable it is to share what I learn and experience in life. That was the reason I started this blog, newsletter, and podcast. The same reason why I went to my high school. Holding AMAs, talks, and sharing an experience brings information about the things you can't google.

It's such a motivating interaction to meet with others and talk about life, experiences, and leanings. I am fortunate and privileged to be where I am today. I'm also aware that many people pursue my road. The only way to continue on my road is to make it better and easier for people coming after me. And the only way to do that is by sharing what I learned and experienced.
