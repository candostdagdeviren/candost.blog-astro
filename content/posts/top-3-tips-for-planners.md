When I started my new system, I also changed my perspective on my day-month-year plans. I didn't know the fundamentals of planning. I always made plans, but I abandoned them after a while. Because I failed to stick to them, and I discouraged myself from making new ones. When I learned these tips, they made my schedule more flexible; everything became organized. I started achieving more than I expected. I also attached it to my plan more than ever.

1. **Put a buffer around [goals](/growth-with-systematic-bliss/).**
    The idea of putting a buffer time around the plan is glorious. Let's say I plan to finish a book in a week. Instead of putting a one-week timeframe in my program, I put around ten days (one and a half-day at the beginning and the end). Many unexpected things can happen in life. And this way, I make my plan adaptable to them. While my goal is still one week, I'm less likely to fail. If I cannot begin reading the book, I still have more time to start.

2. **Be flexible.**
    The idea is to change the plan whenever it is apparent that it will not work out. I plan my days hour by hour, so I have no other option to make my program adaptable to change. I plan my next day hourly before I go to bed. And during the day, I usually cannot stick 100% to my plan. Whenever I see that I'm moving away from my plan, I quickly rearrange it in two-three minutes. This way, I still keep ownership of my day, and I know what I want to do next.

3. **Use failure as [feedback](/importance-of-the-feedback/).**
    Related to the second tip, whenever I see that my plan is not working out anymore, I try to determine the main reason. Vital signs are always easy to see. I take note of why my plan failed, and I use these signs in my next planning. Feedback is a secret weapon of any working system.

While working on any kind of system, I keep these three things in mind. I try to apply these also to my software projects as well. So, learning these skills is helpful in different aspects of life.

One last thing to keep in mind: **you don't have to plan your days**. While planning is working for me, and I quite like it, it may not be a thing for you. There are many happy people without plans. So, **if you think planning is not for you, don't feel forced to do it.**

If you plan your days, what are your tips?
