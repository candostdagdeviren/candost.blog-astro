As of November 2023, I have a new [ritual](/the-power-of-ritualization-rituals-vs-routines/). We have a new dog, Leda, who accompanies us in our lives. I take her out for a walk every morning. That [morning walk](/csikszentmihalyi-newport-and-pressfield-on-creativity-time-and-deep-walks-in-remote-work/#let's-go-to-deep-walks) became one of the most peaceful moments in my life.

Walks have a magical nature. They help me ponder things that I haven't found time for elsewhere.

For a while, I used the silence to think about a lot of things. I was walking with Leda at 5 a.m. for a reason; it was the most soundless time of the day.

Later, I changed the walking time to 8:00. As the city woke up and the noise filled the streets, sounds of people and cars started roaring in my head, and with it, broke the peace and my thoughts all together.

To silence the city's outcry, I started listening to audiobooks.

I managed to finish six books already. I can't say that I learned well what I listened to. I *think* I understood some ideas from the books, but I still need to figure out how I *learn* from them.

Without converting those ideas into writing, it's challenging to learn anything at all.

I, at least, need to try to explain what I have learned. Recording my thoughts using speech-to-text might help, but I rarely use speech-to-text and haven't given it a try during an audiobook session.

That's why, if I liked an audiobook, I also bought the paper version and added it to my library. Then, I started *reading* the book. [Building a personal library](/newsletter/mediations-4/) is very important to me, and the books that pass my [inspectional reading](/how-to-get-to-the-end-of-a-pile-of-unread-books/#inspectional-reading) (listening to an audiobook at 1.7x speed is a kind of inspectional reading) will always have a place on my bookshelf.

Anyway, audiobooks are now becoming part of my life, and I'm looking for a proper audiobook app other than Audible. It would be ideal if the authors and narrators get the most money I will pay for an audiobook. I still couldn't do a proper research. If you have any recommendations, just reply to this post.
